British Foreign Secretary David Cameron reportedly discussed with former President Trump – the presumptive Republican presidential nominee – a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.     According to a source who spoke to The Sunday Times, Cameron met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last month and told the former president that new U.S. aid would help Ukraine hold its front lines and give Trump the \"best possible conditions\" to attempt to secure an agreement with Russia. The source reportedly said that Cameron asked Trump: \"What are the best conditions in which you as president can make a deal in January? It’s both sides holding their lines and paying a price for that.\"That contradicts the United Kingdom's position that a peace agreement would be a Ukrainian matter, and Cameron has said publicly that \"peace comes through strength, not through appeasement and weakness.\"   BLINKEN MAKES UNANNOUNCED DIPLOMATIC TRIP TO UKRAINE AFTER CONGRESS APPROVES $60B IN MILITARY AID  British Foreign Secretary David Cameron addresses guests at the annual Lord Mayor's Easter Banquet at Mansion House on May 9, 2024, in London.

      "       Having trouble? Click here. The Biden administration has been taking criticism as of late for what some have described as conflicting messaging on key subjects relating to the United States' top Mideast ally: Israel.    During a daily briefing last week, Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich pressed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about the administration's attestation to an \"ironclad commitment\" to Israel while \"slow-walk[ing] arms sales.\"Jean-Pierre replied, in part, by reiterating America's commitment to Israeli security remains \"ironclad.\"  Meanwhile, President Biden himself pledged that if the Israel Defense Forces incur substantively into the southern Gazan city of Rafah, \"I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem.\"  BLINKEN DELIVERS STRONGEST REBUKE OF ISRAEL YET: ‘GET OUT OF GAZA’ Video  Several lawmakers have taken issue with the administration's stance, including Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who called the president's recent tack \"another shortsighted decision by Biden that undermines our allies, emboldens our adversaries, and sends the message that the U.S. is unreliable.\"\"Our adversaries would love nothing more than to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Israel,\" Rogers told Fox News Digital in a statement Friday. \"Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas and Iran.\"  Rogers' counterpart in the Senate, Armed Services Committee ranking member Roger Wicker, R-Miss., also called out Biden over a May 8 Associated Press report that the U.S. indeed paused a shipment of bombs in response to Israel potentially making a decision on a \"full-scale assault\" on Rafah.\"If Hamas laid down its weapons, the war would be over. But if Israel lays down its weapons, it would be the end of Israel,\" Wicker said.   MIKE PENCE ACCUSES BIDEN OF IMPEACHMENT HYPOCRISY Video    \"Unfortunately, President Biden has this backwards. He has withheld arms for our staunchest ally one day then professed solidarity with the Jewish people the next,\" the Magnolia State lawmaker added.Former National Security Council official Victoria Coates said of the administration's conflicting messaging, \"you can't have it both ways.\"\"You're going to have to pick a team and put on a jersey and get in a fight. And the administration is desperately trying to please both sides,\" Coates said.    \"And what they've achieved is that both sides are very angry with them. So, you know, it's it's just a massive failure both on the policy and the political front.\"Two other GOP senators, Ted Budd of North Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa, wrote the White House a detailed letter demanding issue-specific answers from Biden on his comments on arms sales and Rafah.Some of the questions posed included demands on which types of ammunition are reportedly being withheld, whether any arms withheld were part of those directly approved by Congress in a recent supplemental appropriation, and how such reports square with the president's April 23 pledge to \"make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and terrorists it supports.\"  \"Why did your administration fail to notify Congress about this decision to withhold assistance to Israel?\" Ernst and Budd asked in the letter.     \"We must give Israel the arms it needs to fight the Hamas terrorists that continue to hold Americans hostage. We call on your administration to immediately restart the weapons shipments to Israel today.\"In a statement, Budd told Fox News Digital one of his constituents, Keith Siegel, remains in Hamas captivity along with seven other U.S. citizens.  \"President Biden is making it harder to secure the hostages’ freedom,\" Budd said.Another Republican lawmaker, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul of Texas, called the threat of an arms embargo a \"dangerous mistake\" and \"shortsighted.\"  On his Fox News program, \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" former Reagan Justice Department chief of staff Mark Levin went so far as to say Biden's actions have renewed \"ancient blood libels against Jews.\"  Stateside, Biden has condemned the \"ferocious surge of antisemitism in America\" and said that \"there’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos\" only after he tried to clean up comments made during a press gaggle where he said, \"I also condemn those who don’t understand what’s going on with the Palestinians …\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Video  The administration has been criticized for declining to take a tough stance against criminal acts committed by some anti-Israel agitators on college campuses or call on law enforcement to step in.    In April, 27 Republican senators wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to demand an update on any efforts to curb the \"outbreak of anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist mobs on college campuses.\"\"These pro-Hamas rioters have effectively shut down college campuses and have literally chased Jewish students away from our schools,\" the letter reads in part. \"The Department of Education and federal law enforcement must act immediately to restore order, prosecute the mobs who have perpetuated violence and threats against Jewish students, revoke the visas of all foreign nationals (such as exchange students) who have taken part in promoting terrorism, and hold accountable school administrators who have stood by instead of protecting their students.\"In response to the protests, Rep. Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., of whose district 90,000 Jewish U.S. citizens call home, drafted the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which successfully passed the House, 320-91, with some \"nay\" votes falling on grounds the bill would purportedly infringe upon First Amendment rights. Lawler's office did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response by press time.

      "       Having trouble? Click here. Voters in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia head to the polls on Tuesday in some competitive and contentious Democrat and Republican primaries that in a couple of cases will tee up crucial general election showdowns that may decide the House and Senate majorities.    The most high-profile of the May 14 primary contests is in Maryland, where Republicans are aiming to flip a Senate seat long held by the Democrats in one of the bluest states in the nation.Popular former two-term Gov. Larry Hogan is considered the overwhelming front-runner for the GOP Senate nomination in a field of more than a half dozen Republican candidates.  \"We like where Larry’s at,\" Senate Republican campaign committee chair Sen. Steve Daines of Montana told Fox News Digital last week. \"We know that’s going to be a tough race because Maryland is a blue state, but it’s a Hogan state first and foremost.\"  WHY SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE CHAIR IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WINNING BACK MAJORITY  Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican candidate for Senate, speaks to patrons at a pub in Frederick, Maryland, on April 6, 2024. (Fox News/Matthew Reidy)  With Democrats hoping to protect their fragile 51-49 majority in the Senate, Hogan's late entry into the Maryland Senate race in February gave them an unexpected headache in a state that was previously considered safe territory.As Hogan cruises toward the GOP nomination, the Democrat Senate primary in the race to succeed retiring longtime Sen. Ben Cardin is grabbing the spotlight. It's a battle between big bucks and high-profile endorsements between the two leading contenders in the 10-candidate field, and it's also a fight over whether electability outweighs diversity.  \"If Larry Hogan wins,\" three-term Rep. David Trone, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, says in his closing campaign commercial, \"we lose more than the majority. We lose a woman's right to choose – could lose Social Security. And with Trump knocking on the door, lose democracy itself.\"THIS SENATE CANDIDATE CAUGHT ON CAMERA SCREAMING AT REPORTER  Trone, the co-founder and co-owner of Total Wine and More, has dished out more than $50 million of his own money to his campaign.    \"The polls say I'm the only candidate who can beat Larry Hogan. And I intend to use every ounce of my energy to do just that. The stakes are just too damn high,\" he said in one of his final ads.Trone has massively outspent Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Black woman who steers Maryland's second-most populous county, which is located in suburban D.C. But he's also sparked controversy with a couple of verbal miscues.  Rep. David Trone, D-Md., and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (Getty Images)Meanwhile, Alsobrooks enjoys the backing of much of the state's Democrat establishment, including endorsements from Gov. Wes Moore, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and five House members.    Alsobrooks, pushing back in a recent ad on insinuations from Trone that she's not experienced enough to handle the Senate, argued that \"while my opponent focuses on fighting, I’ll focus on working for you.\"Pointing to Alsobrooks and Trone, Hogan told Fox News' Mark Meredith on the eve of the primary that \"I don't know which one's going to limp out of that primary. But we'll be ready.\"While Democrats control the Senate now, Republicans are looking at a favorable election map this year with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.  TRUMP EDGES BIDEN IN THESE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES    Three of those seats are in red states that former President Trump carried in 2020: Ohio, Montana and also West Virginia, where Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election.\"The first state that we know that we’re going to win at this point is West Virginia,\" Daines said. \"There’s one pickup seat right there.\"  Republican Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who is term-limited, is the favorite to win Tuesday's GOP Senate primary.A billionaire businessman who owns the state's famed Greenbrier Resort and a Democrat who became a Republican seven years ago, Justice is part of a crowded field of GOP candidates where conservative Rep. Alex Mooney is his main competitor.  Republican Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., left, and GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (Getty | AP Photo/Chris Jackson)  The Republican nominee will be considered the overwhelming favorite in November to flip the Democrat-held seat. Don Blankenship, a former coal company CEO who was convicted of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards, is running in a field that also includes Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott, who has Manchin’s endorsement, and Marine Corps veteran Zach Shrewsbury, who has the backing of progressive groups.  While Republicans aim to recapture the Senate majority for the first time in four years, Democrats are looking to take back control of the House, which they lost by a razor-thin margin in the 2022 midterms.And one of the Republican-held seats they are eyeing is Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, which is anchored by Omaha and its surrounding suburbs.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images/File)    He's facing a challenge from his party's right flank from candidate Dan Frei, who is backed by Nebraska's state GOP. A primary victory by Frei would be considered a political gift to Democrats as they aim to flip the district in November.In a very rare occurrence, both of Nebraska's Republican senators are up for election this year and both face nomination opposition in Tuesday's primary.Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term in the Senate. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a former governor, is running to finish the remaining two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, who stepped down in 2023 to become University of Florida president.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  In West Virginia, with Justice term-limited and running for the Senate, the GOP gubernatorial primary is taking center stage. State attorney general Patrick Morrisey, the 2018 Republican Senate nominee, former state Rep. Moore Capito (the son of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and grandson of the late Gov. Arch Moore Jr.), auto dealer Chris Miller (son of Rep. Carol Miller), and West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner are among the candidates.    Huntington Mayor Steve Williams is unopposed for the Democrats' gubernatorial nomination.  President Biden and former President Trump (AP Photo/Alex Brandon | Curtis Means/DailyMail.com via AP/Pool)All three states will be holding presidential primaries, where Biden and Trump – who've both long since clinched their respective Democrat and Republican nominations – look to pad their delegate totals.  But Tuesday's primaries could provide further headaches for both candidates, with the likelihood of more \"uncommitted\" votes in the Democrat primaries to protest the president's support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza. In the GOP contests, expect a small percentage of continued support for former U.N. Ambassador and former South Carolina Gov.

      "       Having trouble? Click here. Prosecutors will continue their questioning of Michael Cohen on Tuesday after the ex-Trump attorney spent a full day on the stand Monday testifying against former President Trump in his criminal trial.    Cohen is said to be the star witness for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his team as they try to prove the former president falsified business records related to a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.Bragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains his innocence.  Cohen, who once famously said he would \"take a bullet\" for Trump, his former longtime boss and friend, testified against him about his role in arranging the alleged hush-money payment to Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election in an effort to keep her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump in the early 2000s from becoming public.   MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIES HE SECRETLY RECORDED TRUMP IN LEAD-UP TO 2016 ELECTION  Michael Cohen and Donald Trump   Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger led the questioning.Cohen testified Monday that working at the Trump Organization was \"fantastic\" and working for Trump \"was an amazing experience.\"  Cohen testified that he spoke to Trump multiple times a day and often lied for his boss, saying he did so because \"it was needed in order to accomplish the task.\"\"The only thing on my mind was to accomplish the task and to keep him happy,\" Cohen said.   Hoffinger asked Cohen if it was accurate to describe himself as a \"fixer\" for Trump, to which he replied, \"It’s fair.\"    But as for the payment to Daniels, Cohen testified that in October 2016, he told Trump that Daniels must be paid to quiet her claims ahead of Election Day the following month.When Daniels emerged, Cohen said Trump was \"really angry with me.\"  This courtroom sketch shows Michael Cohen on the stand during former President Trump's criminal trial in New York City on May 13, 2024. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)Cohen recalled Trump telling him: \"’I thought you had this under control, I thought you took care of this.’\"     Cohen said he explained to Trump that he had taken care of Daniels’ allegations as far back as 2011, but as the story resurfaced, Trump directed Cohen to \"just take care of it,\" calling the situation a total disaster and reasoning that it would hurt the campaign's chances with women voters.MICHAEL COHEN'S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONYThe ex-Trump attorney testified that he spoke with Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg about how to fund the payment, with Weisselberg saying he was not in a position to initially foot the bill.  \"I ultimately said, ‘OK, I’ll pay it,’\" Cohen testified, noting the urgency behind the matter as the election was just days away. Cohen described to the court that Daniels' claims would have been \"catastrophic to Mr. Trump and the campaign\" if he did not take control of the situation and iron out the NDA and payment to Daniels.     Weisselberg, according to Cohen, said, \"Don’t worry, we’ll make sure you get paid back.\" Cohen said he did not discuss the matter with his wife and decided to gather funds through a home equity line of credit instead of drawing the money from his personal account.  \"My wife was CEO of the household, [she] would not understand $130,000 missing from our joint account,\" he said.  In this courtroom sketch, Michael Cohen is questioned by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger during former President Trump's criminal trial in New York City on May 13, 2024. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)Cohen and Weisselberg informed Trump that Cohen would be using personal funds to front the payment, to which Trump responded, \"cGood, good,\" according to the testimony.   Cohen said he was \"doing everything that I could and more in order to protect my boss, which is something I had done for a long time. But I would not hand out a 130k NDA for somebody else.\"  He also said he would not have proceeded with a payment to Daniels without Trump's approval first, saying that \"everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off … on top of that, I wanted the money back.\"  Stormy Daniels and her lawyer, Clark Brewster, pose for a photo in the witness room at Manhattan Supreme Court on May 7, 2024. (Brewster & De Angelis Law Offices)The ex-Trump lawyer went on to say he opened a bank account with First Republic Bank to transfer the funds to Daniels, but he testified that when he did so, he fraudulently described the account as one that would deal with \"management consulting.\"  Cohen further testified that he was not truthful regarding the intent of the account as he did not believe the bank would allow him to proceed if they knew it would be used to pay a former pornography actress.    The prosecution introduced call logs from Oct. 26, 2016, showing that Cohen called Trump twice to get his \"sign-off\" and to ensure he had Trump’s approval for the deal.NY V TRUMP: COHEN TESTIFIES TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS FROM HIS OWN POCKETCohen ultimately wired the funds to Daniels' attorney, Keith Davidson, telling the court that he marked the payment as a \"retainer\" even though it was \"to execute the NDA\" and to obtain exclusive rights to Daniels' claims.  The funds were wired on Oct. 27, 2016.  Cohen went on to explain that he used \"DD\" as the initials for Trump’s pseudonym, David Dennison, in the nondisclosure agreement paperwork with Daniels. He said the fake name was needed because \"the purpose was to make sure his name did not appear anywhere.\"  This courtroom sketch shows former President Trump sitting with his eyes closed as Michael Cohen testifies during Trump's criminal trial in New York City on May 13, 2024. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)Also during testimony Monday, Cohen admitted to secretly recording conversations with Trump without his permission ahead of the 2016 election. The conversation was about a $150,000 payment to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker after he worked to silence ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal and her claims of an affair with Trump.    Pecker had pressed Cohen that Trump needed to pay him back, with Cohen secretly recording Trump on Sept. 6 of the election year as proof Trump planned to pay Pecker, according to the testimony. Cohen added that in addition to easing Pecker's mind that he would be repaid, he also made the recording to keep Pecker \"loyal\" to Trump.  This courtroom sketch shows David Pecker being questioned by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass during former President Trump's criminal trial in New York City on April 26, 2024. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)The recording was played for the jury, which included Cohen telling Trump that he needed to \"open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\" referring to Pecker.  \"So, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump is heard saying.  TRUMP, DEFENDERS SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF COHEN TESTIMONYCohen argued in his testimony that Trump knew Pecker had purchased the rights to McDougal's claims of an affair and agreed to pay $150,000.\"He already knew based upon conversation with David, which is why he mentioned the number 150,\" Cohen said.    Cohen testified that he recorded the exchange on his iPhone while sitting across a desk from Trump, who was unaware he was being recorded.  Also Monday, Cohen testified that he \"didn't want that role\" of chief of staff but had \"wanted my name included ... to at least be considered.\"\"It was more about my ego,\" he said.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  After turning down an offer to be assistant general counsel in the White House, Cohen said he personally pitched Trump on the possibility of being named the personal attorney to the president.\"I thought that he would need it because there were still outstanding matters we were dealing with, and every president has a personal attorney,\" he said.  Cohen said he presented the idea to Trump, who a day or two before the inauguration officially made Cohen the title of personal attorney to the president.

      "       Having trouble? Click here. If Michael Cohen’s testimony yesterday had a familiar ring, that’s because his main role at the outset was to confirm the account of the National Enquirer’s publisher.    While there were bits and pieces of news, prosecutors walked through meetings, phone calls, e-mails and texts with Donald Trump and others as he vouched for just about everything David Pecker had told the jury.But if there’s one line that jumped out at me, it was this: When Trump confided he would soon launch his first campaign in 2015, Cohen says his boss told him: \"There’s going to be a lot of women coming forward.\" That would prove to be prescient.  And the following year, when Cohen warned Trump that former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal was alleging an affair, the future president’s response was: \"She’s very beautiful.\"  STORMY ALLEGES ONE-NIGHT STAND WITH TRUMP, AGREED TO LIE FOR HER $130,000 PAYOFF  Michael Cohen is questioned by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, in Manhattan state court in New York City, U.S. May 13, 2024, in this courtroom sketch. (REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg )  Cohen’s credibility as Trump’s \"fixer\" – prosecutors raised the word, knowing the defense would – will come under fierce attack. He is a convicted liar who has served time in prison. That may well be the ballgame. The trial could easily turn on whether the Manhattan jury believes he is telling the truth now.There is little question about Cohen’s motivation. He has been on a crusade against the man he served for 10 years ever since their public break. In fact, Judge Juan Merchan told the prosecution on Friday to warn Cohen to make no further comments, given Trump’s complaints that he was being attacked but under the gag order could not respond.  This came after Cohen posted a TikTok picture of himself wearing a T-shirt showing an orange head behind bars. No, not much mystery there.One interesting tidbit came up as Cohen described being \"on top of the world\" during the decade he worked for Trump. He had billed $100,000 worth of work for a Trump entertainment unit. The real estate developer then offered him a job, then said, perhaps half-jokingly, that he’d be fired the first day if he brought up the unpaid bill. Cohen’s job was then to pressure law firms into lowering their bills.  During this time, D.A. Alvin Bragg’s prosecutor asked, would Cohen lie for Trump? \"Yes ma’am.\" Would he bully for Trump? \"Yes ma’am.\"    Cohen’s description of a summer 2015 meeting with Trump and Pecker matched the publisher’s account. The Enquirer would run positive stories about Trump, negative stories on some of his opponents, and Pecker would warn the \"Apprentice\" star if someone else had a negative story and try to suppress it.Cohen would preview articles and covers in advance, as Pecker had said – such as a false allegation that Hillary Clinton had a brain injury – and would tell Trump, in part, to get credit.The first test came when the Trump Tower doorman who the Enquirer paid $30,000 for what proved to be an utterly bogus story about what tabloids always call a love child. Cohen advised they add a $1 million penalty if the man violated the agreement.    NY V. TRUMP: COHEN TESTIFIES TO PAYING STORMY DANIELS FROM HIS OWN POCKETNext up was Karen McDougal, who the prosecution has decided not to call as a witness, perhaps to avoid giving Trump a point on which to appeal.The catch-and-kill payment would cost the Enquirer $150,000. Trump approved, and in the call that Cohen taped, suggested they pay in cash, but his lawyer said a check would make the transaction look legitimate.  Meanwhile, Pecker was \"angry’ and \"upset,\" saying that was too much money for him to hide from the CEO of his parent company.    Meanwhile, McDougal and her lawyer rejected the deal, Cohen feared she was talking to ABC, but then they accepted the agreement.  Former U.S. President Donald Trump sits with his eyes closed as Michael Cohen is questioned by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger during Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, in Manhattan state court in New York City, U.S. May 13, 2024 in this courtroom sketch. (REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg) Pecker wound up telling Cohen to forget the reimbursement. The reason? A cover shoot with McDaniel for Men’s Health – which along with fitness columns was the cover for the deal – sold better than expected, and they were planning a second one. That was worth at least $150K, Cohen was told.  The other extremely important answer from Michael Cohen involved the payment to Stormy Daniels, whose demand he regarded as \"catastrophic\" after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. Cohen asked Trump about his wife. According to his testimony, Trump said just get it past the election. If he won, the Stormy Daniels business would become irrelevant, and if he lost, no one would care.  Cohen declared: \"He wasn’t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.\"  KENNEDY COVER-UP: FAILING TO DISCLOSE A BRAIN-EATING WORM AND OTHER PROBLEMSThis is a crucial distinction. For Trump to be worried about protecting his wife and family – as former aide Hope Hicks, not a hostile witness, contended – was legitimate. Doing it for campaign reasons opens the door to a political manipulation and ultimately the falsification of records charge.  The rest of the story predictably plays out. Cohen stalled on providing the money. Daniels canceled the deal, her lawyer telling Cohen she was going with the Daily Mail instead. Trump was mad, telling Cohen he thought this had been taken care of. Then the deal was back on.     After speaking to Trump, Cohen went to the bank on Oct. 16, 2016 and transferred the money from his home equity line of credit, buying the life rights to Stormy’s tale. Cohen testified that he would not have done this without the approval of Trump, who said, \"Don’t worry, you’ll get your money back.\" (And he eventually did.)A last scare: When the Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 4, just before the election, on the Enquirer’s deal with McDougal, Cohen consulted several times with Hicks on the best spin for the press. He had Stormy’s denial but sat on it after concluding the story wasn’t getting much attention.  Trump speaks to the media on May 13.  (SETH WENIG/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Cohen was relaxed during the testimony, say reporters in the courtroom, but to me the most salient point is this:  What alternative version of events can Trump’s attorneys possibly offer to Cohen’s testimony? His account is backed up by emails, texts, call records, encrypted Signal messages, bank transfers and one audiotape. Those are beyond question. Can the defense argue that Cohen, David Pecker and Keith Davidson, the lawyer for both Daniels and McDougal, are all lying?  They can challenge Cohen’s motivation, but not the well-documented sequence of events.The Trump team will obviously say that Cohen lied many, many other times. That he got involved in the dirty taxi medallion business. That he spent time in prison. That he’s made money by turning on Trump, that he’s become a national figure and cable pundit by turning on Trump. All true, and perhaps that will be enough to discredit him.    The rest of the day was spent inoculating Cohen against the eventual cross-examination. Cohen said he was \"beyond angry…truly insulted, personally hurt\" when Trump cut his 2016 bonus by two-thirds.Cohen wanted to be mentioned for White House chief of staff, though it wasn’t a good fit, because of ego. He wanted to be Trump’s personal lawyer for no fee, which Trump granted at the last minute, meaning Cohen could charge companies big bucks as someone with access to the new president. And he was reimbursed for the $130,000 hush money payment, plus a bonus, at Trump’s direction.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Look, sleeping with a porn star or Playboy model is not a crime. Signing an NDA is not a crime. But if all 12 jurors agree that Michael Cohen was telling the truth on the stand, the former fixer may get his fix after all.

The Nevada Supreme Court on Monday struck down a proposed ballot initiative that would allow voters to decide whether to repeal the public funding that lawmakers approved last year for a new MLB stadium in Las Vegas.

But a growing chorus of stadium economists, educators and some lawmakers had warned that it would bring minimal benefits, especially when compared to the hefty public price tag.  The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that the entirety of the 66-page bill must be included in the ballot question to provide its full context. But ballot referendums can be no more than 200 words — which lawyers for Schools over Stadiums admitted made it difficult to explain the complex bill during oral arguments last month.The court ruled that the 200-word description submitted by Schools over Stadiums was \"misleading\" and \"explains the general effect of a referendum, but it does not describe the practical effects of this specific referendum.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Attorney Bradley Schrager, who represents the two plaintiffs who are labor union lobbyists in favor of the public funding, said on Monday that \"all Nevadans have a right to participate in direct democracy, but they need to observe the laws that require properly informing the voters of a proposal.

President Biden has in recent days warned Israel against incurring into the southern Gaza city, threatening to halt munitions shipments if an invasion commences.Four people familiar with the situation told the Washington Post the administration is offering intel on Hamas tunnels and the hideouts of its leaders if Israel pulls back.

The president could also choose to trigger this with the number at 4,000 a day. But for Republicans who have been highlighting the border issue for years, many have stated repeatedly that it needs to be considered an emergency and shut down right away, not once a threshold is met. In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., reflected on the issues with the negotiated bill. \"The nastiest part of that was the 4,000 migrants threshold that gave the president discretion to stop processing asylum claims,\" he said. \"That implies that Congress doesn't believe the president has discretion right now,\" he said. \"The president does.\"    \"And then, even worse, that discretion went away after three years,\" Johnson added, referring to the fact that the border provision would expire in three years. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION GRANTED SANCTIONS RELIEF TO ARAB NATIONS JUST BEFORE PRESIDENT'S ISRAEL AID THREAT  Sens.

Four Republicans voted with Democrats to overcome the procedural hurdle, while six Democrats defected.   Lankford's office did not provide comment to Fox News Digital when asked if he would support the bill he helped negotiate again.     Democrats in the upper chamber have continued to reiterate their support for the stalled bill, especially as the 2024 election map features several incumbent Democrats in difficult match-ups in states where voters consider the border a top issue. Schumer's potential move to re-up the measure would come just months before the pivotal elections.   \"I assume that almost anything done between now and the election will be perceived as a political exercise and not taken seriously by the voters,\" predicted Republican strategist John Feehery. \"The problem for Democrats is that Republicans will make them vote on the Trump immigration plan which unites the Republicans and divides the Democrats and put vulnerable Democrats in a very tough spot.\"Per fellow GOP strategist David Kochel, Democrats might be looking to revive the bill \"because they see the damage the border crisis is doing to Biden and the Democrats, and they need to try and change the narrative to blame Republicans for being obstructionists.\"  BACKERS OF ANTI-ISRAEL RADICALS ARE FUNDING DEM RIVAL'S SENATE RUN, RED-STATE REPUBLICAN SAYS  The border has emerged as a top issue going into the November election. (James Breeden for New York Post/Mega)  National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Mike Berg said in a statement: \"Joe Biden could secure the border tomorrow by reinstating President Trump’s policies that he unilaterally canceled. The truth is, Biden and Democrats intentionally opened our border and allowed a full-scale invasion of our country. They are only pretending to care about the issue now because it has become a political problem.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., did not provide comment to Fox News Digital.   \"It’s definitely a smart decision to reintroduce the bipartisan border bill,\" said Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff.     \"By putting the bill back into focus, Schumer will once again call the GOP’s bluff on the important issue,\" he predicted. He added that it further presents \"an opportunity to shift some focus back to a domestic policy issue – the border – at a time when the two main stories for months have been about Israel and the Trump trials.\"Eric Schultz, senior adviser to former President Obama, claimed, \"There’s no more devastating proof point of Republicans’ phoniness than their rejection of an immigration border bill that their own colleagues negotiated.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  \"They are so obliged to Donald Trump that they’d turn a blind eye to the issue they pretend to care the most about, and turn their backs on each other,\" he said, noting a second rejection of the measure would prove Republicans are not operating in \"good faith\" on the border. As for the fate of the Senate bill if it managed to pass the upper chamber, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would be unlikely to bring it to the floor. A spokesperson for his office said in a statement: \"Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats already have a House-backed bill that has bipartisan support which will solve the southern border catastrophe engineered by the Biden administration, but they’re letting it collect dust in the Senate.\"  Julia Johnson is a politics writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business, leading coverage of the U.S. Senate.

      "close      Video Sen. Pete Ricketts says Biden has 'strengthened' Hamas by withholding aid from Israel Sen. Pete Ricketts said during a segment of FOX Report with Jon Scott that President Biden has 'strengthened' Hamas by withholding aid from Israel. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel stressed on Monday that no conclusions have been reached by the U.S. on whether Israel possibly violated international law in Gaza after a critical report on Friday.     \"The report makes clear that this is a very complex and complicated battlefield. It is a very dense and urban setting. We are also dealing with the belligerent, in this case, Hamas, that has a clear track record and history of co-locating itself with civilians and civilian infrastructure, using civilians as human shields,\" Patel told reporters at a press conference. \"The IDF has undertaken steps to implement international humanitarian law obligations for the protection of civilians in the current conflict.\" \"We also are clear in our report that it's reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under the National Security Memorandum has been used by Israeli security forces in instances that are inconsistent with its obligations. But we also have no direct indication of Israel intentionally targeting civilians,\" he added. \"Israel does have a number of ongoing active criminal investigations pending, and there are hundreds of other cases under administrative review. Israel has taken steps to and is taking steps to hold itself and its actions accountable.\"   His remarks come after Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered an overdue national security memorandum to Congress on Friday that said Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law, though wartime conditions prevented American officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes. The critical report also noted Israel has had to confront an \"extraordinary military challenge,\" as Hamas \"has embedded itself deliberately within and underneath the civilian population to use civilians as human shields.\"   GRAHAM: BIDEN THREAT TO PULL MILITARY AID FOR ISRAEL 'REWARDING THE TACTICS OF HAMAS TO PUT CIVILIANS AT RISK'  Vedant Patel, principal deputy spokesperson for the State Department, defended the department's critical national security assessment Monday. (Yasin Oztürk/Anadolu via Getty Images)  The report states Hamas \"intentionally uses schools, hospitals, residential buildings, and international organization facilities for military purposes\" and \"constructed a vast tunnel network beneath this civilian infrastructure not to protect civilians, but to hide its leaders and fighters and from which it stages and launches attacks.\" Hamas also continues to hold more than 100 hostages in Gaza. \"Given the nature of Hamas's track record of co-locating itself with civilians using civilians as human shields, we're unable to make a conclusive determination as it relates to violations of international humanitarian law,\" Patel said on Monday. \"There is a moral and strategic imperative to take every possible step to minimize civilian casualties, steps that we know that the IDF has the tools and the capability to undertake.… But simultaneously that this is also a belligerent that is using civilians as human shields. And therefore, we've not been able to come to any kind of conclusive conclusion on this.\"   Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke out strongly against Israel on Sunday amid the Jewish state's operation in the city of Rafah in Gaza. (AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)  BERNIE SANDERS SAYS ISRAEL SHOULDN'T RECEIVE 'ANOTHER NICKEL' IN US MILITARY AID AFTER STATE DEPT. REPORT\"We didn't issue this memorandum because we thought any country was necessarily violating these standards,\" he added. \"Instead, we wanted to be transparent about the standards that we require countries to adhere to and offer an assessment of a certain time period that the national security memorandum is consistent with.\"  Blinken on Sunday delivered some of the Biden administration’s strongest public criticism yet of Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza, saying Israeli tactics have meant \"a horrible loss of life of innocent civilians\" but failed to neutralize Hamas leaders and fighters and could drive a lasting insurgency. In a pair of TV interviews, Blinken underscored that the United States believes Israeli forces should \"get out of Gaza,\" but also is waiting to see credible plans from Israel for security and governance in the territory after the war.     Hamas has reemerged in parts of Gaza, Blinken said, and \"heavy action\" by Israeli forces in the southern city of Rafah risks leaving America's closest Mideast ally \"holding the bag on an enduring insurgency.\"  The makeshift tents of displaced Palestinians at a temporary camp on the coastal strip near Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Sunday, May 12, 2024.

We need to see that, too.\" Blinken also said that as Israel pushes deeper in Rafah in the south, a military operation may \"have some initial success\" but risks \"terrible harm\" to the population without solving a problem \"that both of us want to solve, which is making sure Hamas cannot again govern Gaza.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    More than a million Palestinians have crowded into Rafah in hopes of refuge as Israel's offensive pushed across the Gaza Strip. Israel has said the city also hosts four battalions of Hamas fighters.Israel's handling of the war, Blinken said, has put the country \"on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy, and probably refilled by Hamas.

      "       Having trouble? Click here. A Democrat mayor is facing scathing criticism over the \"haphazard\" implementation of a limit on the length of time migrants could stay in city shelter — with a new report finding that the policy was hurried, lacked clear objectives or written protocols.    The report was issued by Comptroller Brad Lander and looks into the implementation of the policy issued by New York City Mayor Eric Adams' administration in October 2023, which limited stays in migrant shelters to 60 days.The policy came at a time when the city was being crushed by an influx of new arrivals who had traveled up from the border and into the sanctuary city, where there was a \"right to shelter\" policy. Adams had said repeatedly throughout 2023 that the city was overwhelmed and needed more federal assistance.  ADAMS TOUTS NYC'S ABILITY TO ‘MANAGE’ MIGRANT CRISIS, OFFERS ABBOTT FREE STAY AT SHELTER DURING TRIP   A new report looks into the implementation of the policy issued by New York City Mayor Eric Adams' administration in October 2023. (Luiz C. Ribeiro/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)  When the policy was implemented, the city had said it was receiving an average of 600 people a day, and had over 64,000 still in custody.   The policy said that the city would give 60 days notice to families with children, while also helping them find \"alternative housing\" and provide additional casework services to \"take the next steps in their journey.\"But the comptroller's report found that the rule was launched without written objectives and found that the case management consisted of \"little more than repetitive screening for alternatives to shelter.\"  \"Moreover, the policy has been implemented in a haphazard manner. No written policies are in place for key elements of the program; even the exemption of women in the final months of pregnancy, announced after pregnant women were evicted, is not a written policy provided to staff or shelter providers,\" the report found. \"Families are not provided with adequate notice of their right to return to shelter, or of their right to seek reasonable accommodations that could lead to a waiver of the rule.\"The report also found that the rule undermined migrants’ ability to obtain work authorization and unemployment, and the city does not evaluate program effectiveness.

Our City can do so much better.\"    Adams' office responded to the report by highlighting its record amid the enormous numbers of migrants it has seen flood into the city. It says that it has written policies for areas referenced in the report used to guide implementation, including a policy for pregnant women, training and exit planning. His office says they have more than 18,000 children in temporary housing enrolled in schools and have provided over 65,000 immunizations. \"With more than 195,000 migrants coming through our care since the spring of 2022 — more than 65,600 of which are still in our shelter system — and hundreds of more people arriving every single day asking for shelter, our 30-and-60-day notices are one tool in our very limited toolbox to help migrants to exit shelter because, as we have repeatedly said, New York City is long past its breaking point,\" a City Hall spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"Nearly half of all families who have seen their 60-day notices expire, and more than 65%  of all migrants that have come through our care, have moved out of our shelter system — without a single migrant family with children being forced to sleep on the street,\" they said. \"While several suggestions made in the comptroller’s report are already part of our policy, any ideas on how to improve our herculean work are welcome and will be considered. But let’s be clear: A national humanitarian crisis requires a national solution.\"  The spokesperson said they continue to call on New Yorkers to urge the federal government for \"meaningful financial support, to create a national resettlement strategy for migrants, and to finish the job they started by allowing the hundreds of thousands of those they let into this country to immediately work.\" Video    CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRecently, Adams touted his handling of the crisis and said he hoped Texas Gov. Greg Abbott would stay in a shelter when he visits the city.

The first lady's remarks come as the Biden administration continues to take heat over its machinations to cancel student loan debt.Yet, the U.S. national debt is climbing at a rapid pace and has shown no signs of slowing down.

Mike Collins, R-Ga., said, \"the decay of checks and balances isn't a flex.\"    In his 2020 campaign platform, Biden called for making community colleges and tech schools free.However, an analysis by The Associated Press suggested that the cost of his proposal stopped short of the $1 trillion mark, a figure associated with the more expansive education funding plans championed by his progressive counterparts, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.President Biden's 2025 fiscal budget also seeks $90 billion to expand access to free community college despite congressional and judicial resistance.

Democrats hold a major advantage in four of this year's crucial battleground Senate races, but President Biden isn't getting that same good news, according to a series of New York Times, Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College polls released early Monday.    The Democratic incumbents, or likely nominees, in the Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Senate races all lead their respective GOP opponents, or hypothetical opponents, with less than six months to go until the general election in November, but the president trails former President Trump in almost every single battleground state, often by a significant margin.Incumbent Democratic Sen.

According to the testimony, Pecker had paid former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 to purchase her story that she had an affair with Trump and to subsequently quiet her claims ahead of the election. Pecker had pressed Cohen that Trump needed to pay him back, with Cohen secretly recording Trump on Sept. 6 of the election year as proof Trump planned to pay Pecker, according to the testimony. Cohen added that in addition to easing Pecker's mind that he would be repaid, he also made the recording in order to keep Pecker \"loyal\" to Trump.   TRUMP, DEFENDERS SHOW UP IN FORCE AHEAD OF COHEN TESTIMONY  Michael Cohen has been mocking former President Trump on TikTok.

Prosecutors say Cohen paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to quiet her claims of the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses, and are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime.

She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump's hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels also described to the court how she got into the pornography business after working as an exotic dancer as a teenager.

      "close      Video Sen. Bob Menendez's corruption trial set to begin in Manhattan federal court Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's upcoming corruption trial on 'Fox Report.' Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is facing his second federal corruption trial in a decade, as jury selection is scheduled to begin in Manhattan federal court on Monday, this time related to charges alleging that he acted to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar.     The 70-year-old New Jersey Democrat and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are accused of accepting bribes from three wealthy businessmen – real estate developer Fred Daibes, Wael Hana and Jose Uribe – in his home state and performing a variety of favors in return, including meddling in criminal investigations and taking actions benefiting the governments of Egypt and Qatar.Menendez, 70, will stand trial along with two of the businessmen, Daibes and Hana. All three have pleaded not guilty. Uribe has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the other defendants. A trial for the senator’s wife, who is also charged, is delayed until at least July for health reasons.   The three-term senator has announced he will not be seeking reelection on the Democratic ticket this fall, although he has not ruled out running as an independent. That could complicate things for Democrats who have a narrow edge in the U.S. Senate and can hardly afford the prospect of a three-way election in the Democratic stronghold of New Jersey.  TRUMP, HOUSE DEMS DEFEND TEXAS CONGRESSMAN ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING MEXICAN BRIBES, BUT FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS  Monday saw several new court filings from defense teams, but the judge has yet to rule on those matters.Attorneys for Menendez accused prosecutors of not acting in good faith by seeking to have members of the Qatari Investment Company, who have already been interviewed by government counsel, avoid cross examination at trial. The senators’ lawyers allege \"the government knows from their meetings with the Qatari Investment Company Deponents’ counsel and with one of the Qatari Investment Company Deponents that the Deponents’ testimony would disprove the story the government wants to tell.\"  Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., departs the Senate floor in the Capitol, Sept. 28, 2023, in Washington.  (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)  Adam Fee and Avi Weitzman, Menendez’s lawyers, said the \"government will do whatever it can to prevent the jury from hearing the truth from the Qatari Investment Company Deponents, while also presenting to the jury dozens of communications from those very same witnesses.\"\"The Court should not reward the government’s sharp tactics,\" they wrote.  Meanwhile, current and former attorneys for Uribe, who is expected to testify as a witness at trial in the government’s case, accuse Menendez of \"a blatant and improper attempt to end-run around the discovery limitations\" through \"three facially improper subpoenas,\" which seek information about Uribe’s plea agreement with prosecutors, payments Uribe made toward Menendez’s wife’s Mercedes-Benz and other communications and documents. Uribe pleaded guilty on March 1 pursuant to a cooperation agreement.    \"Indeed, it appears that by serving not one but three clearly and facially defective subpoenas, failing to respond to Uribe’s counsel’s objections and requests to withdraw them, and disguising a Rule 17(c) subpoena as one for trial testimony, Menendez and his counsel are intentionally attempting to create an inappropriate burden on – and distraction for – Uribe shortly before the trial begins,\" Uribe's lawyers wrote.After charges were announced in September, Menendez was forced out of his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Sen. Bob Menendez, left, and his wife Nadine Menendez arrive at the federal courthouse in New York, Sept. 27, 2023.  (AP Photo/Jeenah Moon, File)The senator's political career had its first major crisis in 2015 when he was indicted on charges involving a wealthy Florida eye doctor accused of buying Menendez’s influence through luxury vacations and campaign contributions. At the time, Menendez resolutely denied the charges and vowed not to quit the Senate. A trial ended in 2017 with a deadlocked jury, and federal prosecutors in New Jersey abandoned the case.    Menendez not only stayed in Congress, he was reelected and kept his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. He married Nadine Menendez in 2020 after the couple dated for two years.In the new case, federal prosecutors stressed that FBI agents who searched the senator's New Jersey home allegedly found a stash of gold bars, worth more than $100,000, and more than $486,000 in cash, some of it stuffed into the pockets of clothing hanging in his closets in a raid two years ago. Menendez has remained in the Senate amid this latest indictment, ignoring calls for him to step down before his six-year term ends Jan. 3. Unlike in 2015, though, his party has largely abandoned him. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and others called on him to resign. Democratic Rep. Andy Kim launched a campaign for Menendez’s seat the day after the indictment.  SEN BOB MENENDEZ MAY BLAME HIS WIFE NADINE DURING FEDERAL CORRUPTION TRIAL: COURT DOCS    His fellow Democrats in Washington, D.C., appear to have already written him off, encouraging him repeatedly to resign, but Menendez has maintained a defiant stance. \"I am innocent and will prove it no matter how many charges they continue to pile on,\" he said after the indictment against him was updated again in early March to add charges that he tried to obstruct the investigation.   Besides charges including bribery, extortion, fraud and obstruction of justice, Menendez also is charged with acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. Menendez has vigorously denied doing anything unusual in his dealings with foreign officials. The senator's lawyers in court papers have said they plan to explain that Menendez had no knowledge of some of what occurred because his wife, who allegedly often served as a conduit between the men paying the bribes, kept him in the dark.  Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talks at the Senate Finance hearing on Capitol Hill Thursday, March 21, 2024. in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)  According to an indictment, Daibes delivered gold bars and cash to Menendez and his wife to get the senator's help with a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, prompting Menendez to act in ways favorable to Qatar's government. The indictment also said Menendez did things benefiting Egyptian officials in exchange for bribes from Hana, as the businessman secured a valuable deal with the Egyptian government to certify that imported meat met Islamic dietary requirements.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn pleading guilty several weeks ago, Uribe admitted buying Menendez's wife a Mercedes-Benz to get the senator's help to influence criminal investigations involving his business associates.  Judge Sidney H. Stein has rejected Menendez’s attempt to claim legislative immunity protects him from the charges. The judge has yet to rule on whether the defense can call a psychiatrist to show Menendez habitually stored cash in his home as a \"fear of scarcity\" response to family stories about how their savings were confiscated in the Communist revolution in Cuba, before he was born, and because of financial problems stemming from the gambling problem of his father, a struggling carpenter.Fox News' Jennifer Johnson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.   Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

      "close      Video Biden faces waning support among Black Americans: Poll Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams and political analyst Gianno Caldwell join 'The Story' to discuss President Biden's fading support among Black voters in new polls. Former President Trump has the edge in five of the six key battleground states where he was narrowly edged by President Biden four years ago, according to new polls.    The surveys, released Monday by the New York Times, Siena College and the Philadelphia Inquirer, suggest that discontent over the economy and the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, and a deterioration in support for Biden by younger, Black and Hispanic voters, \"threaten to unravel the president's Democratic coalition.\"Biden topped Trump by razor-thin margins in the 2020 election in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to win the White House.  However, according to the new polls, with just under six months to go until Election Day, Trump leads Biden among registered voters 49%-42% in Arizona, 49%-39% in Georgia, 49%-42% in Michigan, 50%-38% in Nevada, and edges the president 47%-44% in Pennsylvania, with Biden narrowly on top in Wisconsin 47%-45%.  2024 REMATCH: TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND THE MAP IN HIS BATTLE WITH BIDEN  Former President Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, speaks at a campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, on Saturday, May 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)  The 2024 rematch between the Democratic president and his Republican predecessor was closer among the narrower pool of likely voters. Trump held the advantage in five states - Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - with Biden edging ahead in Michigan.The surveys' findings were similar when third-party and independent candidates were added to the mix, including Democrat turned independent White House contender Robert F. Kennedy Jr.   The longtime environmental activist and high-profile vaccine skeptic, who is the scion of the nation's most storied political dynasty, was grabbing around 10% support across the six states. The polls suggested Kennedy was drawing roughly equally from both Biden and Trump.POLLS INDICATE DEADLOCKED RACE WITH SIX MONTHS UNTIL ELECTION DAY  The new surveys, conducted April 28 through May 9, come as Trump makes history as the first current or former president to stand trial in a criminal case. Additionally, they were also conducted amid a massive ad blitz by the Biden campaign across the key battleground states.    However, \"the polls offer little indication that any of these developments have helped Mr. Biden, hurt Mr. Trump or quelled the electorate’s discontent,\" the New York Times writes.  President Biden arrives at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Friday, May 10, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)The surveys spotlight that voters are dissatisfied and itching for change. Nearly seven in 10 said that the nation's political and economic systems need major changes, or should be entirely torn down.Nearly three-quarters said they believe Trump will bring major changes if he wins in November, compared to less than a quarter saying the same thing about the president.    The polls also indicate Trump is making gains with voters who overwhelmingly supported Biden four years ago.CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTIONTrump and Biden are roughly tied among voters 18–29 years old and Hispanic voters. The surveys also suggest the former president is grabbing over 20% of Black voters' support, which, if it stands on Election Day, would be the highest level of backing by Black voters for a GOP presidential nominee in generations.  The polls suggest the economy continues to pull Biden down. Even though jobs are soaring and the stock market is booming, inflation remains a major issue for voters, even though it has cooled over the past year. More than half of those surveyed said they believe the economy is still \"poor.\"  President Biden and former President Trump (AP Photo/Alex Brandon | Curtis Means/DailyMail.com via AP, Pool)    However, the president remains in contention, as the surveys point to Biden holding ground with older voters and White voters, whom the polls highlight \"are much less likely to demand fundamental changes to the system and far likelier to say that democracy is the most important issue for their vote.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Abortion remains a potential problem for Trump. Nearly two-thirds of voters questioned in polls say that abortion should always or mostly be legal, including 44% of those supporting the former president.Over 4,000 voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were questioned in the polls, with an overall sampling error for all respondents of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.

Former President Trump was joined by a bevy of high-profile supporters Monday morning outside the Manhattan courtroom, where the NY v. Trump trial will hear from key witness Michael Cohen.     As Trump spoke to the media early Monday morning, Republican supporters such as Ohio Sen. JD Vance, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, his son Eric Trump, and others were seen standing behind the 45th president for what is anticipated to be an action-packed day in court.\"I’m proud to be in New York today to support my friend and president, Donald Trump. Americans see this case for what it is—a political circus. The left can lie about President Trump all they want, but the American people aren’t buying it,\" Tuberville said in comment provided to Fox News Digital on Monday morning.    Trump's comments ahead of court Monday focused on his argument that the case is a \"baseless, politically motivated prosecution\" promoted by the Biden administration, while highlighting a recent poll showing him leading Biden in key battleground states.   MICHAEL COHEN'S CREDIBILITY ISSUES, BRAZEN TIKTOK USAGE RAISE MEDIA EYEBROWS AHEAD OF TESTIMONY   Former President Trump speaks to the media on May 13.

Prosecutors say Cohen paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to quiet her claims of the alleged extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors allege the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses, and are working to prove that Trump falsified records with the intent to commit or conceal a second crime.

She alleged that the pair had sex in Trump's hotel room during the event, which Trump has repeatedly denied in public comments. Daniels also described to the court how she got into the pornography business after working as an exotic dancer as a teenager.    Legal experts subsequently sounded off that Daniels’ testimony was irrelevant to the case and that some of her remarks should not have been admitted into the record.

      "Tillerson says accounts of the suffering of the Rohingya are “heartbreaking” — and that if those reports are true, then “someone is going to be held to account for that.”\n",
      "Tillerson — who’s set to visit South Asia next week — is urging the Myanmar government to improve humanitarian access to the population in western Rakhine state.\n",
      "Amnesty International has accused Myanmar’s security forces of killing hundreds of men, women and children during a systematic campaign to expel the Rohingya. More than 580,000 refugees have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August.\n",
      "“We really hold the military leadership accountable for what’s happening,” Tillerson said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “What’s most important to us is that the world can’t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area.”\n",
      "He also called Wednesday for the U.S. and India to expand strategic ties. He pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.\n",
      "He said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership. The two nations share goals of security, free navigation, free trade and fighting terrorism in the Indo-Pacific, and serve as “the eastern and western beacons” for an international rules-based order which is increasingly under strain, he said.\n",
      "Both India and China had benefited from that order, but Tillerson said India had done so while respecting rules and norms, while China had “at times” undermined them. To make his point, he alluded to China’s island building and expansive territorial claims in seas where Beijing has long-running disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors.\n",
      "“China’s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for,” Tillerson said.\n",

      "U.S.-India relations have generally prospered in the past decade, in part because of their shared concerns about the rise of China. While President Donald Trump has looked to deepen cooperation with China on addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea, he’s also sought a closer relationship with India, which shares U.S. worries on Islamic extremism.\n",
      "“In this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace and prosperity, the United States is that partner,” Tillerson said.\n",
      "Tillerson said the U.S. wants to help improve India’s military capabilities, and also improve security cooperation among the region’s major democracies, which included Japan and Australia.\n",
      "Tillerson said the U.S. and India were leading regional efforts on counterterrorism. He called for India’s archrival Pakistan “to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten its own people and the broader region.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis “will continue until the first bomb drops.”\n",
      "That statement comes despite President Donald Trump’s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with “Little Rocket Man,” a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation’s leader, Kim Jong Un.\n",
      "“I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table. And we have spent substantial time actually perfecting those,” Tillerson told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “But be clear: The president has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically. He’s not seeking to go to war.”\n",
      "Recent mixed messaging from the top of the U.S. government has raised concerns about the potential for miscalculation amid the increasingly bellicose exchange of words by Trump and the North Korean leader.\n",
      "Trump told the U.N. General Assembly last month that if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” Trump also tweeted that Korea’s leadership “won’t be around much longer” if it continued its provocations, a declaration that led the North’s foreign minister to assert that Trump had “declared war on our country.”\n",
      "Tillerson acknowledged during a recent trip to Beijing that the Trump administration was keeping open direct channels of communications with North Korea and probing the North’s willingness to talk. He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.\n",
      "Soon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told “our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man … Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.\n",
      "Analysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing “good cop, bad cop” with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the North’s main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.\n",
      "“Rest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at,” Tillerson said.\n",
      "Asked if Trump’s tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: “I think what the president is doing is he’s trying to motivate action on a number of people’s part, in particular the regime in North Korea. I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table and we have spent substantial time perfecting those.”\n",
      "He added that Trump “has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts, which we are, and I’ve told others those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.”\n",
      "North Korea has launched missiles that potentially can strike the U.S. mainland and recently conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion. It has threatened to explode another nuclear bomb above the Pacific.\n",

      "In August, fellow reporter Jason Patinkin and I crossed on foot from northern Uganda into rebel-held South Sudan. Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world’s most underreported conflicts.\n",
      "Reporting on South Sudan’s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan’s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.\n",
      "This systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.\n",
      "Journalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.\n",
      "Martin Abucha (second from right) rests with his troops in rebel-held South Sudan. Photo by Jason Patinkin\n",
      "We set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.  \n",
      "Just as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or “footing,” as South Sudanese tend to call it.\n",
      "We took off our shoes and waded through the stream’s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we’d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone — but we were about to get a reality check.\n",
      "We had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.\n",
      "“Stop! Who are you and where are you going,” a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.  \n",
      "Instinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the “wrong” rebels? Abucha’s group, called the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.\n",
      "To our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha’s hometown.\n",
      "Keeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country’s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of “two meters per second” (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass. \n",
      "The upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn’t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.\n",
      "The closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn’t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and – most strikingly – no civilians.  \n",
      "The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.\n",

In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill.

Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion.

That level of trust that a commanding officer develops across that unit has to be able to be grounded on dignity and respect, and so … if that officer can lawfully join the United States Navy, is willing to serve and willing to take the same oath that you and I took to put their life on the line, then I’m proud to serve beside them.”\n",

Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.\n",

During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives.

      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            In reality, this Jordan-led hearing isn’t about stopping crime but about defending Trump — who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress.

      "            “I see parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’ and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,” Morissette said in a statement. “I’ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what’s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of ‘Yellowjackets.’”\n",

      "            “Barry” has taken chances from the very beginning, which is certainly true of a fourth and final season that picks up where the third left off, with its hitman-turned-wannabe actor getting arrested. That paves the way for an even darker season that accentuates the show’s ensemble aspect while leaning a little too heavily on blurring lines with flights of fancy.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            Thanks to “Succession,” “Barry” won’t be the highest-profile goodbye on HBO this spring, but the Emmy-nominated series isn’t chopped liver either. It’s fair to say, in fact, that while these episodes don’t quite measure up to what’s gone before, even a less-lethal “Barry” is still very, very good.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Hader’s auteur turn as director-producer-star remains one of TV’s most unpredictable series, and the new season has a strong “Better Call Saul” vibe to it, triggered by fallout from the seemingly inevitable fact that Hader’s Barry couldn’t maintain his double life forever.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            The consequences of his arrest flare out to both sides of that equation, from his acting teacher Gene Cousineau (as played by Henry Winkler, still a towering mixture of ego and need) and girlfriend Sally (Sarah Goldberg) to the rogues gallery of petty criminals in his orbit, including Fuches (Stephen Root) and NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan), who has improbably found love in the course of his travels, while somehow turning “Barry” into a four-syllable name.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            “Barry” has always wrestled with the discomfort of having a protagonist who murders people, and the question of empathizing with its namesake becomes particularly acute in these episodes with the character in prison. When Barry asks, “Are you mad at me?” with an almost-childlike naivete, it’s easy to forget, at least momentarily, some of the horrible things he’s done, even if the revenge-minded Jim Moss (Robert Wisdom) can’t.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            Hader (who directed every episode) also excels at darkly comic visual gags, which are augmented in the new season with a few hysterical cameos by actual Hollywood figures, among them director Guillermo del Toro, made even funnier by how random they seem to be.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            That said, the show’s surreal digressions and detours into fantasy become more distracting, in a way that feels a little too precious at times. The saving grace, consistently, is the strength of the cast, even if prison creates impediments to their interactions.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            HBO made most but not all of the season available, and the series effectively keeps the audience on edge and guessing about where it will all end up, and how (or if) its various threads will connect.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "            The likelihood of a happy ending for everyone in “Barry”-land never seemed to be in the cards, but Hader and co-creator Alec Berg appear determined to exit on their own terms, as good (mostly) and sporadically frustrating as that might be. That’s why it’s hard to get mad at a show that takes such bracing creative risks, even with a season that isn’t quite the stone-cold killer that it has been.\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "“Barry” begins its fourth and final season April 14 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n",
