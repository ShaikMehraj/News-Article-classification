      "close      Video Michael Cohen set to testify in NY v Trump trial in Manhattan  Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn joined Fox & Friends to discuss her take on what Michael Cohens testimony will do to the case and why she believes Stormy Daniels details were inconsistent.  Michael Cohen, ex-lawyer for former President Donald Trump, is expected to testify on Monday, Fox News has learned.     Cohen is expected to be the star witness for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his team for his role in arranging a $130,000 payment in 2016 to adult actress Stormy Daniels to reportedly keep her story that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in the early 2000s. Trump, later, made several payments of $35,000 to Cohen, who was his personal attorney at the time. Trump has denied the encounter happened.  Those payments served as the basis for Bragg's indictment of Trump on charges of falsifying business records. Bragg is trying to prove those payments were reimbursements for the payment to Daniels.

      "close      Video Newsom: California homelessness crisis is ‘disgraceful’ Fox News host Sean Hannity exclusively interviews California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who addresses the homelessness crisis and businesses leaving his state. Some California Democrats are turning on their Golden State leader after Gov. Gavin Newsom's homelessness council failed to track whether billions of dollars spent on curbing the homelessness crisis were successful in the last five years.     \"You come to a budget committee, and there’s no numbers,\" Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting said to Newsom's housing and homelessness officials during Monday's budget committee hearing. \"How many people have we helped? How many people are off the street?\"\"Because that's what people want to know,\" he added.   A California Interagency Council on Homelessness (CICH) executive responded that they're dealing with \"data quality issues,\" so metrics are not yet available for how more than $20 billion was spent since the council's inception.  \"We're working expeditiously,\" executive officer Meghan Marshall said.   NEWSOM IGNORING CALIFORNIA CRISES TO PROMOTE HIMSELF IN PRO-ABORTION CAMPAIGN, GOP LAWMAKERS SAY  California Gov. Gavin Newsom faces backlash for untracked $20 billion worth of state homeless resources and programs. (MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images | Contributor/Mario Tama/Staff)\"What does that mean though? We spent billions of dollars, and you can't tell us at all how many people we've helped,\" Tang said.  Megan Kirkeby, deputy director for the California Department of Housing and Community Development, told lawmakers in the committee that the state didn't previously require them to track its progress on spending or the viability of its programs, adding it's not \"something to be proud of.\"CICH, the blue state's hub for coordinating the state's homeless programs, shifted blame to local cities last month in an emailed response to Fox News Digital's inquiry about the failure to track the money. A senior spokesperson said municipalities \"are primarily responsible for implementing these programs and collecting data on outcomes that the state can use to evaluate program effectiveness.\"  As the state faces a significant budget deficit that must be worked out by a July deadline, both Republicans and Democrats in the legislature fear the audit's findings could interfere with multiple city requests for more funding to address the homeless crisis. California is ground zero for the most homeless people in the nation, with more than 181,000 people living on the streets.     LOS ANGELES IN HOT WATER FOR SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ON WORSENING HOMELESS CRISIS  A homeless man walks through the downtown Los Angeles Skid Row neighborhood on Dec. 12, 2022. (Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images)In a bombshell report last month, the state auditor found that nine state agencies have collectively spent $24 billion in state funding over the past five years in administering at least 30 programs dedicated to tackling the homelessness crisis, and the auditor said Newsom's homelessness council \"is responsible for coordinating, developing, and evaluating the efforts of these nine agencies.\"The state's independent audit noted CICH is required by law to report its finances related to all state‑funded homelessness programs but that it stopped doing so in 2021.      Over the past five years, the CICH didn’t consistently track whether the money actually improved the situation, the audit concluded. It also failed to collect and evaluate outcome data for these programs due to the lack of a consistent method.In a letter to the governor, the state auditor wrote that \"the state must do more to assess the cost-effectiveness of its homelessness programs.\"GOV GAVIN NEWSOM FACES RECKONING WITH $73B BUDGET DEFICIT LAWMAKERS SAY HE HELPED CREATE  Proposition 1 adds $6 billion to California funding for homelessness. (Fox News)  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Despite billions spent on homelessness and housing programs during the 2018-2023 fiscal years, the problem didn’t improve in many cities, according to the state auditor's report. Since 2013, homelessness has jumped more than 53%.Newsom consequently called for cities to take more rigorous steps to enforce the state's progressive housing laws. In a press conference, Newsom announced the state would expand a Department of Housing and Community Development agency to enforce compliance with laws that require cities to meet a threshold of new homes, leading to legal action against rebellious cities like Huntington Beach that have refused to increase building.  \"I'm not interested in failure any longer,\" the governor said.Newsom's office nor CICH responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment by time of publication.

      "close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for May 9 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Some Alabama lawmakers, and even Gov. Kay Ivey, expressed disappointment and frustration on Thursday as the legislative session ended without a final vote on a gambling bill.    Though the bill passed in the House earlier in the session, a scaled-back version of the measure failed by one vote in the Senate and supporters were unable to break the impasse.  Because the bill wasn't approved during this session, voters will not have the opportunity to vote on gambling within the state later this year – continuing a 25-year stalemate on the issue.  \"There was a lot of effort to try to make it work.

GAMBLING BILL STALLS IN ALABAMA LEGISLATURE DURING SESSION'S FINAL HOURS  Alabama lawmakers ended the legislative session on Thursday without coming to an agreement on a gambling bill after it came to an impasse in the Senate despite easily passing the House. (Taylor Hill/Getty Images)  The bill approved by the House would have allowed a lottery, sports betting and up to 10 casinos with slot machines and table games, but the Senate approved a stricter version that only included a lottery and allowing dog tracks and other sites to have machines where players can bet on replays of horse races.Senators were more reluctant to approve the idea of slot machines or video poker.  A conference committee proposed a compromise that would have authorized a statewide lottery and slot machines at seven locations in the state, but that also did not win approval in the Senate despite approval in the House.\"It was something that there weren’t votes in the Senate to approve,\" Republican Senate President Pro Tem Greg Reed said of the conference committee proposal. \"So that’s where we are.\"  ALABAMA LAWMAKERS PROPOSE BILL TO INTRODUCE STATE LOTTERY, 10 CASINOS  Alabama senators were reluctant to the idea of approving legislation allowing slot machines and video poker in the state.

Kay Ivey told reporters Thursday she was disappointed in the outcome because she \"wanted people to have a chance to vote on the issue.\" When asked if she would call a special session for the subject, the governor said it would be pointless without lawmakers reaching an agreement.Republican Rep. Chris Blackshear, the sponsor of the legislation, said the passing of the bill would have provided the state with more money for education, roads and other needs.    \"We had it as close as it’s been before. We had a chance,\" Blackshear said of the chamber's effort.Rep. Barbara Drummond, a Democrat, noted that Alabamians are traveling to neighboring states to purchase lottery tickets, which benefits residents elsewhere.\"I’m frustrated today,\" she said. \"The House stood up like it should, but it hit a wall upstairs. It’s time we stop playing these games of special interest and look out for the people who send us here.\"  Alabama does not have a lottery and lawmakers expressed frustration at residents having to purchase scratch-off tickets in other states, which benefit programs elsewhere.

      "close      Video Rep. Issa reacts to growing antisemitism within Democratic Party amid anti-Israel campus protests The California Republican spoke to Fox News Digital about the reasons he is \"deeply disappointed\" in President Biden’s response to the protest. Republican Congressman Darrell Issa told Fox News Digital it would be a \"huge help\" if President Biden disavowed and rejected donations from progressive groups that are fueling the anti-Israel protests nationwide, while also explaining that the tepid response from Democrats shows the rise of antisemitism within the party.    \"If the president would come out, whether it's George Soros or a host of other supporters and be honest and say that, you know, not only would he send the money back but he wants them to stop funding people who support violence it would be a huge help,\" Issa said. \"I don't expect him to do it.\"The anti-Israel protests have been organized by groups fueled by progressive donors, including George Soros, some of whom have also donated to the Democratic Party and Biden, Fox News Digital reported last month.  Soros recently gave $250,000 to help Biden win re-election and Politico reported earlier this month that some major Biden donors have also funded groups associated with the college protests.   'SHAMEFUL': GOP LAWMAKER SHREDS 'AWOL' BIDEN FOR THROWING JEWS 'UNDER THE BUS' AMID ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS  L- Columbia anti-Israel protest R- President Biden (Getty Images)  Issa told Fox News Digital that the response to the protest from Democrats has been an example that antisemitism has found a home within the party. \"The growth of The Squad and people who think the same and are willing to talk the same, or at least support them has certainly caused people to realize that the party of the Democrats of Robert F Kennedy, John Kennedy and for that matter of Steny Hoyer is gone,\" Issa told Fox News Digital this week.    \"They're no longer willing to stand up for Israel or against antisemitism and it's now coming home to be seen in these incredible amounts of votes where they won't support Israel.\"Issa told Fox News Digital he is \"deeply disappointed\" by President Biden’s response to the anti-Israel protests on college campuses nationwide and explained that the president’s desire to \"placate\" both sides is an indicator that antisemitism has been festering in the Democratic Party for years.   BIDEN VOWS TO WITHHOLD WEAPONS FROM ISRAEL IF NETANYAHU GOES FORWARD WITH RAFAH INVASION  Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, speaks during a hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)    \"I think President Biden is trying to placate both sides, tell both sides that he's in the middle,\" Issa said. \"He's managed to upset the Middle Eastern community many of whom wanted decisive action and the Israel and pro-Israel community who see him as hurting the effort to bring to an end, if you will, Hamas and their allies.\"\"I'm really sad because, historically, they've enjoyed both Arab and Israeli pro-Israel votes, Jewish votes and the Republicans have always been the party that has supported Israel. George W Bush, no stronger friend, President Trump, no stronger friend. You know, president after president promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem. President Trump did it. So, when you really look at it you realize that for a long time we've been the pro-Israel party. Only now are people realizing that real antisemitism exists in the Democratic Party, and it's condoned there.\"President Biden waited 9 days before giving on-camera remarks about the anti-Israel violence on campus which Issa said was a key reason why the protests spread the way they did.     \"President Biden needed to say on day one to all the governors of either party that you act or I will act because, in fact, the civil disobedience that turns into violence is a federal issue,\" Issa said. \"Had he done that, had he challenged the governors to go in aggressively and quickly, this would be over instead of watching it grow.\"Issa, who was in high school in Ohio during the unrest and shootings at Kent State University in 1970, told Fox News Digital he is concerned that history is repeating itself.\"As someone who was in high school when Kent State had its riot and not only did they close after May 4th but so did almost every university around the country, I see history repeating itself in a nasty way,\" Issa said. \"The protests against the Vietnam War were fine, violence wasn't fine, and they were slow to get past it because many of the professors were on the same side as the students.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   A protester holds a Palestinian flag during a march on Columbia University campus in support of a protest encampment supporting Palestinians (REUTERS/David Dee Delgado)    Issa continued, \"This is the same situation, the antisemitism on campus, the elite are part of that.

Very few states, even governors have been willing to do what Governor Youngkin in Virginia and others did, which was act quickly and if it didn't work, act again.

      "close      Video College students fear Biden losing election over campus protests: 'Michigan is up for grabs'  Young voters in Michigan said the feared backlash over Biden's stance on Israel could split the vote and enable Trump to win the November election. FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans demanded on Thursday evening an investigation into the tax-exempt status of several organizations that have supported various anti-Israel and antisemitic protests at universities across the country.     Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, called on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Danny Werfel in a letter to probe the Americans for Justice in Palestine Educational Foundation (AJP), the Tides Foundation and the Westchester Peace Action Committee Foundation (WESPAC) over their support for anti-Israel demonstrations at dozens of universities.American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), a 501(c)(3) that is fiscally sponsored by AJP, denied any \"corporate relationship with any student groups. AMP does not direct the activities of any student groups. AMP is not the fiscal sponsor of any student groups.\" However, a legal representative for AMP told Fox News Digital that it does \"issue small dollar grants, averaging just under $500 apiece, for costs associated with already-planned events that will further AMP's educational mission.\"  Sen. Joni Ernst penned a letter asking for several organizations to be investigated by the IRS. (Getty Images/File)  \"AMP has been scrutinized before and has every confidence that it will once again be able to show that it operates legally, for legal and constitutionally protected purposes, within the United States,\" the representative said.   \"AMP also supports the rights of any Americans to exercise their First Amendment protection of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and freedom of association with their peers,\" they added.   Neither the Tides Foundation nor WESPAC provided comment to Fox News Digital. ANTI-ISRAEL OCCUPIERS COULD LOSE FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS UNDER NEW GOP SENATE BILL  She cited a recently filed lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against AJP and National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP), brought by victims of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel. They alleged that AJP is effectively a \"propaganda division in the United States\" for Hamas and that the group established the NSJP in order \"to control hundreds\" of chapters at schools all over the U.S.The letter was also signed by 15 other Republicans, including Senate Republican Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who is running to replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as party leader in November. Additional signers were Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, among others.  'NO CHOICE' BUT TO IMPEACH BIDEN OVER DELAYED ISRAEL AID, GOP SENATOR SAYS  The NSJP has been involved in protests across the country. (Getty Images)    Ernst pointed to the plaintiffs' claim that AJP and NSJP \"were prepared and responded to Hamas’s ‘call for mass mobilization’ by disseminating a manifesto and plan of attack\" on Oct. 8, the day following the attack. According to the lawsuit, the manifesto included \"materials that appear to have been created before the attack.\"\"This basis provides ample grounds for you to initiate your own investigation of these entities’ tax-exempt status,\" the letter reads. UNIVERSITIES WOULD PAY 'HEFTY PRICE' FOR ALLOWING ENCAMPMENTS UNDER NEW SENATE BILL  The lawsuit suggested the groups had prior knowledge of the Oct. 7 attack. (Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images)    The Republicans also noted that \"you would not be alone in investigating AJP,\" citing the fact that Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares last year began investigating whether AJP \"used funds raised for impermissible purposes under state law, including [benefiting] or providing support to terrorist organizations.\"Fox News Digital reached out to the IRS and NSJP for comment.NPR CEO KATHERINE MAHER DECLINES HOUSE HEARING INVITE AMID BIAS SCANDAL  A Columbia University building was recently taken over by anti-Israel protesters.

      "close      Video Donald Trump: This judge is 'corrupt,' his ruling is a 'disgrace' Former President Trump says he is 'innocent' and a 'corrupt' judge is presiding. Former President Trump’s criminal trial will resume Friday after Judge Juan Merchan, for the second time, denied his defense attorney’s request for a mistrial following salacious testimony from Stormy Daniels.     Daniels, who claims to have had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, took the stand for cross-examination Thursday morning after hours of questioning Tuesday that even the judge called \"unnecessary\" and \"irrelevant.\"Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges stem from a years-long investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The charges are related to alleged payments made ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence Daniels about an alleged 2006 extramarital affair with Trump.  But the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee declared, \"We are so innocent.\"   TOP 5 MOMENTS OF TRUMP TRIAL AFTER 'SALACIOUS' STORMY DANIELS TESTIMONYTrump defense attorney Susan Necheles vs. Stormy Daniels  Susan Necheles, after cross-examination, said Stormy Daniels’ story about an alleged sexual encounter with the former president keeps changing because the affair never happened. Necheles pointed to a statement Daniels signed in 2018 denying an encounter with Trump ever took place. Daniels said she did not write the statement but signed it.   Former President Trump watches as Stormy Daniels is questioned by defense attorney Susan Necheles (REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg)  Necheles pointed to another statement in which Daniels denied having a sexual relationship with Trump. In part, the statement said, \"I’m denying this affair because it never happened.\"Daniels maintained that she signed the statements, entered a non-disclosure agreement and took a $130,000 payment, which prosecutors allege was illegally marked as legal expenses, for protection. But Trump's team aimed to show that Daniels was after a payday and changed her story when it would lead to profit.   Daniels denied ever requesting money from Trump. Facing pressure from Necheles, Daniels added, \"I never asked for money from anyone in particular. I asked for money for telling my story. … I was asking for money from publications to sell my story, to get the truth out.\"  Former President Trump arrives to court on the first day of opening arguments in his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court  (Victor J. Blue/The Washington Post via AP, Pool)    Daniels admitted to selling the story for nearly $1 million, when she agreed to write her book, \"Full Disclosure,\" for $800,000. But she claimed she did not receive all that money.When asked for specific details about the alleged sexual encounter in 2006 on the sidelines of a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Daniels appeared to tell a different story in court than when she first spoke about the incident, or in her book. \"You told In Touch a completely different story,\" Necheles said, which Daniels denied, adding there were just \"parts in the middle I didn’t remember.\"     STORMY DANIELS’ SALACIOUS AFFAIR STORY KEEPS CHANGING BECAUSE ENCOUNTER NEVER HAPPENED, TRUMP TEAM CLAIMS\"You made it up,\" Necheles said.   Former President Trump watches as Stormy Daniels is questioned by defense attorney Susan Necheles during Trump's criminal trial (REUTERS/Jane Rosenberg)\"No,\" Daniels replied.  Necheles asked Daniels if she knew or understood why Trump was indicted in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case. She said she did not, adding he was \"indicted for a lot of things.\"Former White House aide gets emotional discussing time in Trump admin    Madeleine Westerhout, who previously served as former President Trump's personal secretary in the White House, was brought to tears Thursday on the stand as she described her experience in the administration.The emotion came as Westerhout outlined the former president's relationship with his wife, Melania Trump.  Westerhout said the couple's relationship was one of mutual respect and that they laughed often when they were in the Oval Office.Westerhout said Melania would sometimes text Trump, reminding him that it was past dinner time and asking when her husband was coming home.

She sold her story to the National Enquirer, which never published it, in exchange for $150,000. McDougal's payout is not part of the criminal charges.  Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass defended the decision not to call McDougal, saying prosecutors did not \"change their minds\" about calling her. Instead, prosecutors never formally decided if they would use her as a witness during trial. Judge denies request for gag order modification, mistrial after Stormy Daniels testimony    Judge Juan Merchan denied Trump defense attorneys’ request for a mistrial and a modification of a gag order Thursday, arguing the former president should be able to defend himself against Stormy Daniels’ salacious and \"prejudicial\" testimony.Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche first requested a mistrial Tuesday after Daniels’ first day on the stand but was denied. Merchan did, however, admit Daniels was a difficult witness to control and said much of her testimony was \"unnecessary\" and \"irrelevant\" to the charges.Trump attorneys on Thursday again requested a mistrial.  New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan listens as former President Trump watches Stormy Daniels being questioned. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)  Blanche said the prosecution asked Daniels \"a whole host of questions\" that never should have been asked, pointing to questions about the porn actress’s childhood and her alleged interaction with Trump. Blanche argued they were \"things that are irrelevant to the facts of this case.\"  Blanche reminded that the case is not about sex and again stressed that Daniels’ testimony was \"extraordinarily prejudicial for the jury to hear.\"NY V. TRUMP: JUDGE DENIES REQUEST FOR GAG ORDER MODIFICATION, MISTRIAL AFTER STORMY DANIELS TESTIMONY    \"It is so dangerous, so prejudicial, it borders on a problem from the beginning,\" Blanche said, adding that Daniels' testimony and story about the alleged sexual encounter kept changing.But Merchan denied the request and reminded Blanche that, during his opening argument, he denied Trump had a sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels.   \"Your denial puts the jury in a position to decide who to believe,\" Merchan said, adding the defense could have objected many times during Daniels' testimony \"but didn't.\"   With regard to one explicit detail, Merchan said he agreed that \"shouldn’t have come out … but for the life of me, I don’t know why Ms. Necheles didn’t object.\"Merchan told Blanche he made decisions to strike things from the record to \"protect\" Trump and said he disagrees with any changing narrative while adding that the details \"add a sense of credibility.\" Blanche also requested a modification to the gag order, arguing Daniels made false statements about Trump, and the former president should be allowed to defend himself now that her testimony is complete.     The judge denied that request. Trump declares: ‘We are so innocent’  \"So, what happened today? I don't think we have to do any expert explaining. I'm not allowed to anyway because this judge is a corrupt judge.

A proposal that would reassign Air National Guard troops to the Space Force without the consent of governors is an \"existential threat\" to the part-time force that would erode operational efficiency and eliminate a longstanding precedent, critics say.    Legislative Proposal 480 was submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee by the Department of Defense in an effort to bolster the Space Force, the U.S. military's youngest branch created during the Trump administration. The move would override a longtime tradition that requires the Department of Defense to acquire gubernatorial approval before transferring Guard members to another military branch.\"This is really a wholesale harvesting of the units, the people, the structure, the equipment and the facilities in transferring them out of the National Guard from the governors and just placing them in the active component Space Force,\" retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, president of the National Guard Association, told Fox News Digital.

(U.S. Air National Guard photo by Senior Airman Anneliese Kaiser)  Under LP480, Air National Guard troops who perform space missions could be brought over to the Space Force and designated as part-timers without approval from the governor of the state where the unit is based.   The National Guard and Air National Guard are the primary combat reserve components for the active-duty Army and Air Force. They are called upon to perform a variety of missions when they respond to requests from civilian authorities during emergencies, including disaster relief and security.The National Guard falls under the authority of the respective governors of the 55 states and territories of the United States, until they are federalized, such as when they are deployed to war zones.   \"The original intent of the National Guard was to have a force ready to respond to the needs of their state and country,\" according to the more than 80 congressional lawmakers from both parties who were part of a Tuesday letter to the Senate and House Armed Service committees. \"Because of this, authority was placed in the hands of each state's individual governor. This is more than a matter of governance; governors bear the responsibility to protect the safety of their citizens by maintaining the readiness and deployability of their National Guard units.\"US AIR FORCE SECRETARY KENDALL FLIES IN COCKPIT OF PLANE CONTROLLED BY AI  A new proposal would allow Air National Guard troops to be transferred to the Space Force without gubernatorial consent. (Air Force Capt. Charles Rivezzo | Air National Guard Staff Sgt. Aaron Rodriguez)  All 55 governors have come out against the plan, arguing that it would usurp their authority. Several of them have spoken with Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall III to express their opposition to the measure.    \"Federal law requires consultation and approval from Governors on any decisions to move National Guard units, plain and simple,\" reads a Thursday statement from the National Governors Association (NGA) chair, Republican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, and the vice chair, Democrat Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. \"Until Air Force leaders withdraw LP 480, they are in violation of federal law. We cannot have productive conversations on this matter until LP 480 is set aside. Governors are united on this point.\"Last week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has mobilized National Guard soldiers to assist local authorities in handling illegal immigration at the southern border, called LP480 a \"power grab.\"Fox News Digital has reached out to the Space Force and Kendall's office. In a May 3 letter from Kendall to Cox, the Air Force secretary said the intent of the proposal isn't to set a precedent or disregard the role of governors.     AIR FORCE SETS SIGHTS ON HIGH-TECH LASER WEAPONS  A U.S. F-16 lands as an Air Force C-17 is parked at Aviano Air Base in Italy. (Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty Images/File)\"Rather, the proposal would help complete the standing up of the U.S. Space Force,\" reads the letter, which was obtained by Fox News Digital from a source familiar with the issue.Kendall noted that the Space Force has integrated space missions previously performed by the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The Air Force has decided that such missions performed by the Air National Guard should also become part of the Space Force, he said.   LP408 could impact 1,008 Air Guard troops across 14 units in seven states, according to Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Michael Bruno, the National Guard Association chair of the Space task force. The Space Force as a whole is made up of only a few thousand Guardians, Bruno told Fox News Digital.    Several Air National Guard members are part-time and hold civilian jobs, said Bruno, who noted that a majority would refuse to transfer, which could impact national security because new people would have to be recruited and trained to be mission capable. \"What would happen is we would have a seven- to 10-year gap in capability and readiness,\" Bruno said. \"That capability gap for national security is the most important piece that we would lose, and they're willing to take that risk.\"  The Space Force states its mission is to protect the U.S. to operate freely in space as well as keep it secure, \"stable and accessible for military space power and new waves of innovation.\"  Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall smiles after a test flight of the X-62A Vista aircraft against a human-crewed F-16 in the skies above Edwards Air Force Base in California on May 2, 2024.

They like doing the state mission. They don't have to relocate. So, they're not going to go.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAnother issue that will hamper operations in the future will be recruiting Guard members to fill the mainly administrative roles they will be assigned if transferred to the Space Force, McGinn said.  \"No one is going to sign up for that,\" he said. \"And if they do get anyone dumb enough to be recruited, they're not going to be retained because they're going to be bored, and they're going to leave.\"  Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

SENATE MULLS TIKTOK BAN AS TRUMP-ZUCKERBERG BATTLE BREWS IN BACKGROUND  Big Tech companies sought to assure lawmakers that the industry could take care of problem without interference from the government, Kramer noted. \"But the fact of the matter is, leaving the fox to guard the chicken coop has left Big Tech fat and greedy, because they have prioritized cash over our kids,\" the senator said.  Supporters say the new law aimed at protecting children was crafted to withstand court challenges like one that halted a California law. For example, the measure incorporates case law and established consumer protection law, supporters said.Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of NetChoice, said the group shares lawmakers’ desire to better protect children online. \"But this goal can be achieved in ways that don’t violate the Constitution and leave a litany of serious, unintended consequences in their wake,\" he said.

Moore signed today will fail to accomplish its goal — creating a safer online environment for young Marylanders. An unconstitutional law will not keep anyone safe. By discounting the rights and privacy of their citizens, Maryland lawmakers have unfortunately signed onto a path that will make everyone worse off — especially children,\" Szabo said in an email.  Under the law, businesses would not be able to profile a child by default, with some limited exceptions, or process personal data that is not reasonably necessary to provide an online product with which the child is actively and knowingly engaged.    Del. Jared Solomon, a bill sponsor, said lawmakers were careful to make sure the measure is not meant to moderate available content. He said protective language was added to ensure a child could not be prevented from searching for content online.\"If you want to go and you want to look for things that you probably shouldn't be looking at, we are not scrubbing that from the internet,\" Solomon, a Montgomery Democrat, said. \"But what we are saying to companies is you should not be essentially be accumulating data on somebody and making assumptions that that is the content that they want to see.\"Design It For Us, a coalition advocating for safer social media and online platforms for children, praised the new law.    \"We hope this will bring urgency to other states to pass and adopt much needed Kids Code legislation and end Big Tech’s power over our safety and privacy,\" said Zamaan Qureshi, a co-chair of the group.The governor, a Democrat, also signed the Maryland Online Data Privacy Act of 2024.The new law will impose certain duties on businesses to protect an individual’s personal information. For example, a business in possession of personal information will be required to implement and maintain security procedures and practices to protect the information from unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure.  \"It puts guardrails up on the amount of data that companies can collect on people online and also what they do with that data, and it gives consumers more control over their own data,\" said Del. Sara Love, a Montgomery County Democrat who sponsored the measure.    The new law also will create consumer protections and rights, as well as disclosure obligations, relating to online personal data controlled or processed by certain entities that conduct business in Maryland or provide services or products that are targeted to residents of the state.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  A consumer also will have the right to opt out of the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data and certain profiling activities.\n",

The state of Iowa’s attempts to crack down hard on illegal immigration is being challenged in court.    A newly passed law making it a crime for an illegal immigrant to enter or re-enter the Hawkeye State if he or she has previously been deported or denied admission to the U.S., is being disputed as unconstitutional by civil rights and immigration groups. The complaint filed Thursday alleges that the new statute steps on the federal government’s authority to enforce immigration law. The case is similar to a more expansive Texas law that has been challenged by both the Justice Department and civil rights groups.  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WARNS IT PLANS TO SUE IOWA OVER NEW STATE IMMIGRATION LAW  Civil rights and immigrant rights groups are suing Iowa over the constitutionality of a new law, signed by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, left, making it a crime to be in the state if previously denied admission to the U.S. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images, left, John Moore/Getty Images, right.)  The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and the American Immigration Council on behalf of the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and two individual Iowans. It’s the first legal action taken against Iowa in response to the law, though the U.S. Department of Justice warned the state’s top officials last week.  The bill, Senate File 2340, was signed into law last month by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, gives Iowa law enforcement officers the ability to charge people with an aggravated misdemeanor if they have entered the country illegally. It goes into effect on July 1 and mirrors part of a high-profile Texas law that is currently blocked in court.The law specifically makes it an aggravated misdemeanor offense, which is punishable by up to two years in prison, for migrants in the state who have outstanding deportation orders, who were previously deported or previously prohibited from entering the country.  The crime is raised to a felony offense, according to the new law, if the immigrant's removal orders pertained to misdemeanor convictions for drug-related crimes, crimes against people, or prior felony convictions.However, the claimants argue that the new law conflicts with existing immigration laws by giving law enforcement the power to arrest immigrants who have authorization to be in the U.S., such as those granted asylum or those who were given visas to protect them from crime or trafficking.  Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director at the American Immigration Council, said even a person who has lawful immigration status, could be arrested and deported if they were previously deported or removed and reentered the country.     GOP GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL ALLOWING LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ARREST CERTAIN MIGRANTS, 'ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS'  Audience members listen to community organizers speak during an informational meeting about the bill on March 27, in Des Moines, Iowa. \"It's a law that makes absolutely no sense and is clearly unconstitutional,\" Goettel said. \"SF 2340 isn't just about so-called criminal reentry. It's a badly written law with far-reaching implications. It will create absolute chaos and human suffering in our legal system, and harm Iowa communities.\"Several states are trying to pass laws to clamp down on unprecedented levels of illegal immigration pouring into the country since President Biden took office. In Iowa and across the country, Republican leaders accuse Democratic President Joe Biden of failing to manage the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.    Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states, a Fox News analysis in February found. Tens of thousands more have crossed into the country illegally since then. Reynolds told Fox and Friends on Monday that the DOJ told her administration that the state is interfering with the federal government’s attempts to enforce immigration laws. She said the claims were \"ridiculous\" given the high number of crossings.

Doug Burgum joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss going from running against Donald Trump to potentially being on the short list for vice president. Two months after ending her White House bid, Nikki Haley will huddle early next week with some of the top donors to her Republican presidential campaign, sources confirmed to Fox News.     The former two-term South Carolina governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in former President Trump's administration will use the two-day gathering Monday and Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, to thank her major contributors.But a source in Haley's orbit says the former presidential candidate isn't expected to encourage donors to contribute to Trump's general election campaign and that no endorsement of the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is pending.

Haley launched her presidential campaign in February 2023, becoming the first major candidate to challenge Trump, who had announced his candidacy three months earlier. And she was the final rival to Trump, battling the former president in a two-candidate showdown from the New Hampshire primary in late January through Super Tuesday in early March.Haley announced she was suspending her White House campaign March 6, the day after Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.  WHAT KIND OF FUTURE DOES HALEY HAVE IN A TRUMP DOMINATED GOP?However, Haley made it clear when she exited the Republican presidential nomination race she intends to keep speaking out.  \"While I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in,\" she emphasized as she spoke at her presidential campaign headquarters on Daniel Island in her hometown of Charleston.

Some top members of Haley's campaign, including some from the fundraising team, are expected to attend next week's gathering. Haley and groups aligned with her campaign hauled in over $160 million from nearly 300,000 donors. HALEY ENDS HER WHITE HOUSE BID BUT DECLINES TO ENDORSE TRUMPIn a sign of potential trouble for Trump in his general election rematch with President Biden later this year, Haley continues to grab votes in the Republican primaries even though she's long gone from the presidential nomination race.

      "close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for May 9 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A North Dakota judge on Thursday ordered a state lawmaker to serve 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,500 fine after a jury convicted him of a misdemeanor in connection with a controversial state-leased building he has an ownership in.    State District Judge Bobbi Weiler also ordered Republican Rep. Jason Dockter, of Bismarck, to pay $325 in court fees, undergo fingerprinting and serve 360 days of unsupervised probation. She also granted him a deferred imposition, meaning the conviction will be taken off his record if he doesn't violate probation.A jury on May 3 convicted Dockter of speculating or wagering on official action. The misdemeanor charge is punishable up to 360 days in jail and/or a $3,000 fine. Complaints to the state Ethics Commission led to Dockter's charging in December 2023. He pleaded not guilty.  JURY CONVICTS NORTH DAKOTA LAWMAKER OF MISDEMEANOR SPECULATION  Dockter, 50, is a co-owner of companies that own and worked on the building leased by the late Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem in 2020. The two were friends, but Dockter has denied any wrongdoing in the lease arrangement. The building drew scrutiny when Stenehjem's successor, Attorney General Drew Wrigley, disclosed a construction cost overrun of over $1 million incurred under Stenehjem. The overrun was an unpleasant surprise to state lawmakers, who raised concerns about trust and transparency.  A criminal complaint alleged that, as a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, Dockter voted \"on legislative bills appropriating money to pay for property he had acquired a pecuniary interest in,\" against state law and legislative rules.  North Dakota Republican state Rep. Jason Dockter, left, and his attorney, Lloyd Suhr, meet with others on the steps of the Burleigh County Courthouse in Bismarck, N.D., Thursday, May 9, 2024, after Dockter was sentenced to serve 250 hours of community service and pay a $2,500 fine after a jury convicted him of a misdemeanor in connection with a controversial state-leased building he has an ownership in. ((AP Photo/Jack Dura)Prosecutor Ladd Erickson had recommended a one-year deferred imposition with $325 in court fees and fingerprinting. He also said in a court document that the Ethics Commission \"is the proper body to issue any additional penalties beyond\" his recommended sentence. An investigation by the ethics panel was paused by Dockter's charge, and it can resume after sentencing, Erickson wrote.  Defense attorney Lloyd Suhr agreed with Erickson's recommendation, citing Dockter's lack of criminal history and his family and local ties, and saying he deserves to be treated the same as similar first-time misdemeanor offenders.Dockter declined to comment regarding the sentence. The judge chastised him for that.  \"The reason I wanted to hear something from you is I look at this as the citizens of North Dakota being the victims and being taken advantage of, and I didn't hear an apology from you to the citizens, and I'm a little disappointed in that,\" Weiler said.    The judge said, \"I don't know how more direct and unique it gets,\" regarding the lease situation, a reference to a House rule that members shall disclose personal or private interests on bills that affect him or her \"directly, individually, uniquely, and substantially,\" and may not vote without the House's consent.\"My biggest concern is you don’t think it’s substantial,\" Weiler said.She granted the deferred imposition, but she added the community service hours and fine as stipulations, based on the $250,000 she said he \"made off the citizens of North Dakota\" by voting on a two-year budget bill last year.    \"I was trying to find a way to hopefully help you understand so that we're not seeing this again,\" Weiler said.Dockter must fulfill the community service with the homeless community within six months, or about 10 hours a week, the judge said.\"Maybe you can see how the other side lives, Mr. Dockter,\" Weiler said.  \"I'll take whatever it is you're giving me,\" Dockter told the judge after she asked if he had any questions. He met with loved ones on the courthouse steps afterward.    Suhr said the judge \"was well within her discretion and largely accepted the recommendations of the parties\" on sentencing.Republican House Majority Leader Mike Lefor has said he disagrees with the jury's verdict and plans to review the statute and rules involved.  On Wednesday, Lefor wrote to Republican Rep.

      "Welcome to Fox News’ Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.     What's happening? - Biden faces backlash for reported plan to withhold some weapons from Israel…  - Hunter Biden loses attempts to dismiss criminal charges…  - Trump's stormy day in court…'We are so innocent'  Stormy Daniels wrapped up her testimony in the Trump trial, before a smattering of other witnesses were called to the stand. Judge Juan Merchan also handed Trump a double denial – rejecting motions for a mistrial, and defense attorneys' request to modify the gag order now that former porn performer Daniels has finished her testimony. Trump's team argued that Daniels' time on the stand was highly prejudicial, and had nothing to do with the charges about falsifying business records for a $130,000 payment to Daniels to sign and NDA, and not share her story of having sex once with Trump.   Trump has denied Daniels' claims consistently, and defense attorney Susan Necheles worked hard Thursday to point out how Daniels' story has changed over the years. Trump's attorneys argued that now, with the porn actress' testimony concluded, he should be able to defend himself publicly. But Merchan disagreed, saying that though Daniels was a difficult witness to control, and much of some of her testimony was \"unnecessary\" and \"irrelevant,\" the gag order would stand.\"We are so innocent,\" Trump said after court adjourned Thursday.

      "close      Video New Mexico border area becoming free zone for cartels, state senator says Republican New Mexico state Sen. Steven McCutcheon, National Border Patrol Council VP Art Del Cueto, Chicago resident Cata Truss and former acting ICE Director Ron Vitiello discuss record-breaking illegal immigration under President Biden. The Biden administration on Thursday announced a narrow new rule that would allow officials to remove some illegal immigrants considered a public safety or national security threat much earlier in the asylum process.    The rule would allow statutory denials to asylum typically applied later in the asylum process to be applied earlier at the initial screening process, which typically happens within days of someone arriving at the border. It would apply to those considered a risk to national security, including terrorists, or public safety.A epartment of Homeland Security (DHS) senior official who briefed reporters noted it would likely only affect a small population but said it would be \"an important additional tool in our toolbox that will allow us to remove individuals much more quickly who may pose a risk to the United States, enhancing our security at the border, while at the same time saving taxpayer money.\"  TAXPAYER-FUNDED ID PROGRAM FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS EXPECTED TO BEGIN THIS SUMMER  Immigrants wait to be processed by the U.S. Border Patrol after crossing the border from Mexico in Yuma, Arizona, on Aug. 6, 2022. (Qian Weizhong/VCG via Getty Images)  The administration also announced revised guidance that allows asylum officers to consider whether an asylum seeker could instead relocate to a different part of his home country when assessing if he has a basis for asylum.   The administration says it wants to see more sweeping changes to what it says is a \"broken\" system but says those changes can only come from congressional action.\"The proposed rule we have published today is yet another step in our ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of the American public by more quickly identifying and removing those individuals who present a security risk and have no legal basis to remain here,\" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.   BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE NARROW ASYLUM REGULATION AS BORDER CRISIS REMAINS TOP ISSUE: REPORT  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks to the media  in Las Vegas on Feb. 7. (Candice Ward/Getty Images)\"We will continue to take action, but fundamentally it is only Congress that can fix what everyone agrees is a broken immigration system,\" he said.  The Biden administration last year enacted a broader asylum rule that makes illegal immigrants ineligible for asylum if they have crossed multiple countries without claiming asylum. But it is unclear what effect that has had. Numbers have dropped in recent months, but only after hitting a record high of more than 200,000 encounters in December.     The rule is unlikely to satisfy Republican critics, who have blamed the administration for rolling back Trump-era policies and enacting what they say are \"open border\" policies. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., called the rule \"an unserious, politically motivated attempt to address a significant problem the Biden administration itself created.\" Video\"The rule will not impact or reduce the millions of illegitimate asylum claims being filed by economic migrants. The department currently cannot properly vet the vast majority of illegal aliens crossing the border, as numerous tragic reports from our communities make clear. The Biden administration, however, would have us believe that vetting under this rule will somehow be effective,\" Green said, responding to reports of the rule on Wednesday and adding \"nothing will change.\"    The administration has rejected claims it is embracing \"open border\" policies and has pointed to stats it says show more than 720,000 removals or returns of illegal immigrants since May 2023, more than in every full fiscal year since 2011.Fox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report.Get the latest updates on the ongoing border crisis from the Fox News Digital immigration hub.

      "close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for May 9 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. New Jersey lawmakers pushed ahead Thursday with legislation overhauling the state's public records access law, reigniting debate over the revisions that stalled earlier this year amid vocal opposition from civil rights and other groups.    The Democrat-led state Senate's budget committee approved the amended legislation Thursday, with its Assembly counterpart set to take up the bill on Friday.The bill's revival comes after Republican minority leader Anthony Bucco signed on to co-sponsor the measure and following agreement on concessions by an influential group behind the legislation that represents the state's more than 500 towns and cities.  THREE GROUPS ARE SUING NEW JERSEY TO BLOCK AN OFFSHORE WIND FARM  Among the proposed changes is the end of a prohibition on commercial record requests, by real estate developers for instance. Instead, the new measure would allow government clerks up to 14 days to respond to requests for records and allow for commercial interests to pay up to twice the cost of producing the records.  \"When both sides are potentially not thrilled you have a good compromise,\" Senate Budget Committee chairman Paul Sarlo said.  The General Assembly Chamber of the New Jersey State House in Trenton, New Jersey, is photographed. (Getty Images)Civil rights groups, citizens and media organizations testified Thursday against the measure, citing in particular the end of what they said was a key component of the law: attorney fee shifting, which under current law provides for government agencies to pay legal fees only if the government is found to have improperly denied records.  That provision is important, according to attorney CJ Griffin who testified in opposition Thursday, because journalists and the public often don't have the funds to pursue costly legal cases to obtain records.\"If your goal is to handle commercial requests ... this bill doesn’t do it,\" Griffin said. \"This bill instead guts transparency.\"  The bill's sponsors countered that a court could determine that attorneys' fees were warranted if a government records custodian acted in bad faith.    Another new provision of the proposed measure that drew opposition Thursday was the authorization for lawsuits to be brought in state Superior Court for records that requesters have determined to be interrupting \"government function.\"Sarlo said he thought the criticism was inaccurate, but didn't specify.Lori Buckelew, a top official with The League of Municipalities that pushed for the legislation, said the changes are necessary to protect taxpayer dollars from the abuses of overburdensome records requests.    Paul Mordany, the mayor of Deptford, New Jersey, said his town has 200 pending requests, only three of which are from town residents. The rest are from lawyers, real estate developers and other commercial interests. The stress wears on the town clerk responsible for handling the requests under the Open Public Records Act, or OPRA, he said.\"I literally sat in her office more than one time as she literally cried over OPRA requests,\" he said.Access to officials’ emails and other public records regularly results in news stories shedding light on how the government works.

      "close      Video The NY v. Trump case is devolving into ‘a circus': Jim Trusty Former Trump attorney Jim Trusty joins ‘The Story’ to discuss Stormy Daniels’ testimony in Day 14 of the former president’s case. Judge Juan Merchan on Thursday denied a request for a mistrial and a modification of the gag order by Trump defense attorneys, who argued that the former president should be able to defend himself against Stormy Daniels’ salacious and \"prejudicial\" testimony.     Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche first requested a mistrial on Tuesday after Daniels’ first day on the stand but was denied. Merchan did, however, admit she was a difficult witness to control and said much of her testimony was \"unnecessary\" and \"irrelevant\" to the charges. Trump attorneys on Thursday again requested a mistrial.  Blanche said that the prosecution asked Daniels \"a whole host of questions\" that never should have been asked, pointing to questions about the porn actress’s childhood and her alleged interaction with Trump. Blanche argued they were \"things that are irrelevant to the facts of this case.\"   Blanche reminded that the case is not about sex, and again stressed that Daniels’ testimony was \"extraordinarily prejudicial for the jury to hear.\"   Blanche continued that many of the questions asked by the prosecution were \"prejudicial.\" STORMY DANIELS’ SALACIOUS AFFAIR STORY KEEPS CHANGING BECAUSE ENCOUNTER NEVER HAPPENED, TRUMP TEAM CLAIMS  \"It is so dangerous, so prejudicial, it borders on a problem from the beginning,\" Blanche said, adding that Daniels' testimony and story about the alleged sexual encounter kept changing. Defense attorney Susan Necheles declared earlier Thursday that Daniels \"made it up.\"  Stormy Daniels and former President Donald Trump. (Getty Images)  Meanwhile, Blanche was referring to salacious and sexually explicit questions asked of Daniels during questioning by the prosecution, stressing that the questions had nothing to do with the alleged falsification of business records — which are the only charges Trump is facing,      Prosecutor Josh Steinglass defended Daniels and her testimony, saying that it \"is not a change of story.\" \"They’re trying to have their cake and eat it, too,\" Steinglass said. Merchan explained that at each trial, evidence comes in different ways.     Merchan reminded Blanche that during his opening argument, he denied Trump had a sexual encounter with Daniels. \"Your denial puts the jury in a position to decide who to believe,\" Merchan said, and added that the defense could have objected many times during Daniels' testimony, \"but didn't.\" With regard to one explicit detail, Merchan said he agreed that \"shouldn’t have come out… but for the life of me, I don’t know why Ms. Necheles didn’t object.\"  In this courtroom sketch, Stormy Daniels testifies Thursday in Manhattan state court in New York City during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence former porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)  Merchan told Blanche that he made decisions to strike things from the record to \"protect\" Trump, and said he disagrees with any changing narrative, while adding that the details \"add a sense of credibility.\"     Merchan denied the motion. The prosecution on Thursday also said they would no longer call Playboy model Karen McDougal as a witness, who also allegedly received a hush money payment about an alleged affair with Trump.   Steinglass defended the decision, saying they did not \"change their minds\" about calling her, and said prosecutors never formally decided if they would use her as a witness during trial. TOP 5 MOMENTS OF TRUMP TRIAL AFTER 'SALACIOUS' STORMY DANIELS TESTIMONY  Meanwhile, Blanche also asked Merchan to modify the gag order imposed upon the former president, which blocks him from discussing court staff and witnesses. Blanche requested Trump be released to discuss Daniels.   Blanche said that Trump should be able to respond to allegations of a sexual encounter in 2006 with Daniels — especially now that her testimony is complete and she is no longer an active witness. Prosecutors, however, argued that the defense \"lives in an alternate reality,\" and defended the gag order, saying it is working. Prosecutors also said Trump allies are making his case for him in news interviews.   But Merchan denied the request, saying his \"concern is not just protecting Daniels.\"     \"My concern is protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole,\" Merchan said, adding that the reason the gag order is in place is due to the nature of potential Trump attacks.   In this courtroom sketch, former President Donald Trump watches as former porn star Stormy Daniels is questioned by defense attorney Susan Necheles in Manhattan state court in New York City on Thursday during Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence Daniels in 2016. (Reuters/Jane Rosenberg)\"Your client’s track record speaks for itself,\" Merchan said to Blanche. Merchan, though, said he would be mindful of witnesses using the gag order imposed upon Trump as a shield.   Merchan imposed a gag order on the former president, an order he has ruled Trump to have violated at least 10 times. He has fined Trump $10,000 so far, and warned of jail time for further violations.  \"The last thing I want to consider is jail,\" Merchan said Monday. \"You are [the] former president and possibly the next president.\" Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges stem from a yearslong investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe charges are related to alleged payments made ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence Daniels about an alleged 2006 extramarital affair with Trump.  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg must convince the jury that, not only did Trump falsify business records related to alleged hush money payments, he did so in furtherance of another crime — conspiracy to promote or prevent election, which would be a felony.   On their own, falsifying business records and conspiracy to promote or prevent election are misdemeanor charges.   Brooke Singman is a political correspondent and reporter for Fox News Digital, Fox News Channel and FOX Business.\n",

      "close      Video Fox News Flash top headlines for May 9 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry has been charged with lying to federal authorities about a foreign billionaire's illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign, reviving a case that was derailed by an appellate court.    A federal jury convicted the Nebraska Republican in 2022, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Fortenberry's conviction last year, ruling that the case should not have been tried in Los Angeles.A grand jury in the nation's capital indicted Fortenberry on Wednesday on two counts: falsifying and concealing material facts and making false statements.  COURT REVERSES FORMER NEBRASKA US REP. JEFF FORTENBERRY'S CONVICTION FOR LYING TO FEDERAL AUTHORITIES  Chad Kolton, a spokesman for Fortenberry, said the case should not have been brought in the first place and should not be pursued again after the 9th Circuit ruled in his favor.  \"This case has defined overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation, and retrying it in D.C. just highlights the prosecutors’ vindictive obsession with destroying a good man’s life,\" Kolton said in a statement.

Hong)After his conviction, Fortenberry announced his resignation from the office that he had held since 2005. He had been under pressure from congressional leaders and Nebraska’s Republican governor.  The case stems an FBI investigation of illegal campaign contributions made by Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire who lived in Paris at the time. Chagoury made the $30,000 contribution to Fortenberry through middlemen at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles, his indictment says.Chagoury later agreed to pay a $1.8 million fine. Foreign nationals are prohibited from directly contributing money to candidates for federal offices in the United States.  Fortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Chagoury. A person who cooperated with the FBI investigation repeatedly told Fortenberry about the illegal contributions, his indictment says.    The 9th Circuit ruled that Fortenberry was improperly tried in Los Angeles because he was charged in connection with statements that he made to federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and at his lawyer’s office in Washington.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFortenberry's trial was the first for a sitting member of Congress since Rep.

      "close      Video Watters: Why aren't FBI, media unmasking these traitors? Fox News host Jesse Watters asserts anti-American activists are anticipating \"mob rule\" to win on \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\" EXCLUSIVE: The FBI is disputing reports that the bureau has been urging employees to increase the use of warrantless wiretapping on U.S. soil.    \"Yesterday's reporting in Wired magazine is a complete misrepresentation of the FBI Deputy Director’s email to the FBI workforce,\" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement on Thursday. \"Their allegation that the FBI instructed its employees to violate the law or FBI policies is categorically false and insulting.\"At the heart of the issue is the FBI's use of – and its directions to employees about – the controversial Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). A Wired report on Wednesday quoted an April email sent out to employees about Section 702 by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, including a portion in which Abbate encouraged employees \"to continue to look for ways to appropriately use US person queries to advance the mission.\"  While the section of Abbate’s email released by Wired emphasized the need for employees to use the tools \"properly and in compliance with legal requirements\" and to make sure queries into U.S. persons are \"fully compliant with the law,\" it also appeared to urge more frequent use of the program, arguing that doing so will \"continue to demonstrate why tools like this are essential to our mission.\"  CONGRESS CANNOT LET FISA SECTION 702 EXPIRE  FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/File)  Some lawmakers immediately took issue with the FBI's apparent use of Section 702.\"The deputy director's email seems to show that the FBI is actively pushing for more surveillance of Americans, not out of necessity but as a default,\" Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., told Wired in response to the email. \"This directly contradicts earlier assertions from the FBI during the debate over Section 702’s reauthorization.\"  But the FBI pushed back against Wired’s characterization of the email in the report, issuing a statement to the outlet that accused it of alleging \"that the FBI instructed its employees to violate the law or FBI policies.\"Instead, the FBI said the email \"emphasized Congress’ recognition of the vital importance of FISA Section 702 to protect the American people and was sent to ensure that FBI personnel were immediately aware of, and in compliance with, the privacy enhancing changes the law has put in place.\"  The controversial 702 program allows the government to tap American companies to collect communications like calls, texts and email without the need for a warrant.    A requirement within the program aimed at protecting the privacy of Americans states that at least one of the targeted individuals of a request has to be a foreigner the FBI reasonably believed to not be on U.S. soil.But the Wired report notes that a Justice Department review last year found that the FBI’s compliance rate hovered around 98%, a number that has been touted by FBI Director Christopher Wray and other FBI officials despite it being possible that thousands of its searches were still not in compliance with Section 702 guidelines.Wray defended the program last month, arguing that requiring the FBI to obtain a warrant to scan the database of information under its Section 702 authority would jeopardize its ability to combat national security threats.  A top FBI official reportedly urged employees to make more use of a controversial surveillance program. (iStock)    \"If there’s no constitutional, legal or compliance necessity for a warrant requirement, then Congress would be making a policy choice to require us to blind ourselves to intelligence in our holdings,\" Wray said during a speech in front of the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee on Law and National Security.The entirety of the email, which was reviewed by Fox News Digital, does lay out changes to current procedures for using Section 702 after President Biden signed H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. Notably, Abbate's email highlights that while there will be no changes to the current law that would require a warrant for queries into U.S. persons, there will be additional protections as part of the pre-approval process in order for FBI employees to make such a query.HOUSE BRACES FOR BATTLE OVER RENEWING CONTROVERSIAL FISA SURVEILLANCE TOOL  The email also highlighted Wray's effort to maintain the program, with Abbate telling employees that the FBI was able to give concrete examples that demonstrated to lawmakers how the program has helped \"prevent attacks, warn victims, and inform intelligence analysis.\"  FBI Director Christopher Wray speaks during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on July 12, 2023. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)    In providing the full context of the email to Fox News Digital, the FBI said Abbate was merely highlighting the success of the program and changes to the law, encouraging employees to continue to demonstrate the useful nature of Section 702 while being mindful of compliance with the law.\"The Deputy Director was not asking for FBI personnel to find new ways to use the program, but rather to make full use of the tools which have been provided to us by Congress to protect Americans,\" the FBI said. \"As we have consistently said, U.S. person queries of FISA 702 data are crucial to connecting the dots to identify threat information within our lawfully-acquired holdings.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe FBI also argued that a failure to \"fully identify relevant threat information within that data, including through basic analytic techniques such as querying, puts Americans at unnecessary risk from foreign terrorists, spies, and hackers.\"  \"Having an attorney or supervisor review queries to ensure compliance before they can be run, as mandated by Congress in the new law, is how we can be confident in higher levels of compliance going forward while we use this vital tool to the full extent allowed by law to protect national security,\" the FBI said.

      "close      Video Border Patrol agents capture illegal immigrants in El Paso Sector Fox News Digital was on the ground in El Paso Sector as Border Patrol agents caught illegal immigrants entering the U.S., including one group that cut into a border fence. FIRST ON FOX: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is eyeing a summer rollout for a controversial ID card pilot program for illegal immigrants being released into the U.S. And the agency hopes it will modernize the documentation process for removal proceedings.    The ICE Secure Docket Card program was first reported on in 2022, and Fox Digital obtained images of the card last year. Now, ICE is planning a limited rollout of the program. ICE confirmed to Fox News Digital this week the pilot program is expected to commence this summer with the distribution of approximately 10,000 cards. While the agency stressed that plans are \"pre-decisional\" and still subject to change, it is expected the cards will be issued in three or four locations in the U.S.  A source familiar with the program told Fox Houston and Atlanta were two potential locations.   LEAKED IMAGES SHOW BIDEN ADMIN'S PLANNED ICE ID CARD FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  Images show the ICE Secure Docket Card program. (Fox News)  The agency said the program will \"modernize documentation provided to some noncitizens\" but stressed it would not be an official form of federal ID.\"While the specifics of the card and pilot are under development, it is important to note the secure card will not be an official form of federal identification,\" the agency said. \"The secure card will indicate it is for use by DHS agencies and would be provided only after national security background checks have been performed.\"  When illegal immigrants cross the border and are released into the interior, they are often given a number of paper documents depending on their status and situation. ICE says that such documents pose a security risk and can be lost and degraded, and the new program will make the agency more efficient.It would also allow for an easier verification of identity through DHS systems via officials.  \"Moving to a secure card will save the agency millions, free up resources and ensure information is quickly accessible to DHS officials while reducing the agency’s FOIA backlog,\" the spokesperson said. \"For provisionally released noncitizens, the digital modernization will provide ongoing access to important immigration documents through the secure card and connected portal.\"    ICE DEVELOPING PROGRAM TO GIVE ID CARDS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, AS BORDER CRISIS RAGES  Images show the ICE Secure Docket Card program. (Fox News)But the move is expected to face opposition from some Republicans and conservatives who have expressed broader concerns about the regularization of the release of illegal immigrants, which they have described as an \"invasion\" orchestrated by the federal government.\"Just in time for the election, the Biden administration is quietly legitimizing a government-sanctioned invasion of our nation,\" RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE) and a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital.     \"Providing illegal aliens with identification will undoubtedly lead to obtaining other documents, benefits and rights — or create an entirely new identity. After all, most who cross the border have no identification information in their possession. So, how do we even know who they are?\" VideoRepublicans on Wednesday moved forward with legislation to add a citizenship question to the census to prevent noncitizens being counted for congressional apportionment. Republicans have previously passed a sweeping border security bill that would shut down releases into the U.S. and have blamed the policies of the Biden administration for the crisis.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The Biden administration says it is dealing with a hemisphere-wide crisis and working within a \"broken\" system that needs funding and fundamental reforms by Congress. It has called for the passage of a bipartisan bill negotiated by the Senate, but it has failed to drum up enough support from conservatives.
